1. lol of course Emily is wearing trainers, jeans, and a tank top. We also know pretty damn well that Alex doesn’t need to be dressed to the nines to pass easily, so even if she ultimately did agree to wearing her current outfit (and mostly seems to like it) Ben really shouldn’t have tried to shut her down when she was leaning towards a similar outfit to Emily’s first.
2. “Miss Brewer was my father” lmfao
3. Oh there’s another little dysphoria attack, poor thing
4. It would be nice if James kicked himself in the balls for Alex, but that’s probably optimistic.
5. Embracing being a bit of a bitch is a good move honestly, I’m working on developing that skill myself.
6. And hey to men “being a bitch” generally means “assertive, confident, and willing to be honest in ways the men are too fragile to handle”
7. Yes it’s not your job to baby him after he behaves like a jerk. 
8. Lots of smart women end up in jobs you wouldn’t expect, but also there’s no reason not to believe that she does other things than just model.
9. A well deserved kick under the table imo.
10. Oh no, I just realized I could very easily see people irl getting upset at Alex and claiming she’s being abusive towards James. I’ve seen multiple male “feminists” online make similar claims in the past at the very least.
11. I mean he kinda has been a bit sexually inappropriate Alex, like not even only counting with you that mistletoe ambush thing you talked about happening at the Christmas party was absolutely inappropriate pretty much no matter what.
12. “I wasn’t any kind of ice queen; I was a nervy but friendly idiot. With great legs.” Pfft
13. “I’m not into men” she says. Right after very much being in protesting-too-much territory. Emily is absolutely right that he has it *bad* for Alex, regardless of if Alex is willing/capable of noticing it
14. She is such a trans girl, gets to talk to another woman for the first time while being herself and just spills almost everything that’s on her mind in what’s nearly one continuous gush.
15. Not only was she in an all girl group in drama class she got roped into playing the role of Juliet? That’s a few more spots towards the blackout transfem bingo card right there
16. Damn James gets his brain and his dick called small by two beautiful women within a couple seconds.
17. Yeah like I said: lots of smart women end up in jobs you wouldn’t expect. Good on Alex for having her back on what she was implying interest in. Also yay “it’d be nice to have another woman around the office” she was able to think that without “correcting” herself this time.
18. Congrats on making your first girl-friend Alex! And you got to have fun ordering your "jerk of a friend and arse of a boss" around a bit with her!
19. Well I can think of an easy way to handle the problem of having Emily work with you post-expo: just keep being a woman, it's the perfect solution!
20. So she plans to spend the night at her place, I wonder if this is where we get to find out that her neighbors thought she was a girl already and their only surprise is at her dressing up.
21. She is absolutely the dominant one between her and James, I do like that quite a lot. 
22. Getting some extremely casual clothes is not a bad move, and yeah the worry about getting "caught" is slow to fade. Definitely can't expect it to be gone on the second day of being in public and the first time shopping.
23. Okay seems like Alex is going to go and finish speaking her mind. Let's see how this goes.
24. Ah there goes the bottled up stress and everything else, also James fuck off with that obvious lie, you didn't "just" forget for a how she was dressed or anything else, you were very clearly intentionally trying to forget. Maybe because you somehow thought that would make things feel easier for Alex, but I think it's more likely to make things easier for yourself because of how hard of a time you were having trying to figure out how to act around her when you see her as *her*.
25. At least you're taking a step back and just showing concern without making excuses or the like. Is this the first real food (no tea and coffee don't count) Alex has had all day? If so that certainly hasn't helped with anything either
26. Yes, she absolutely has nothing to apologize for.
27. Holy shit, a man just coming out and not only acknowledging his lie but apologizing for it? Truly astounding! Also I was pretty much 100% correct about what he was really doing in the elevator, good for me.
28. True, you aren't becoming a different person. Instead you're becoming more yourself, though that's probably going to be hard for you to grasp for at least another day or so. Also another point toward James being closer to getting what's going on with Alex, his worries about turning Alex into "another person" is really giving "Taylor Scott" (or her thoughts at a couple points were really giving James seeing as this was written first)
29. Good, don't let him run from having called you a bitch like that. 
30. I'm sure that Alex calling herself a girl in response to James' "shit" metaphor will have exactly no impact on how James is thinking.
31. The man surprises me twice in a few pages: with the owning up to the lie thing and now with acknowledging his past as a misogynistic shithead when he was younger and that calling her a bitch like that indicates something that he has to work through.
32. Don't let him completely off the hook even with the help calming down and the sandwich. Yes exactly! If you're "not that guy" until the moment a woman annoys you then you're still just "that guy" but you've learned a modicum of self restraint. Also Alex is slowly getting less immediate with her "correcting" of herself.
33. Contacting one or more of James' exes to ask more about his behavior is a very good idea honestly. You're also 1000% right that men act very differently around other men then they act around and to women.
34. FFS men are so stupid sometimes, like I assumed you hadn't considered/imagined how Alex would feel in these situations but I still don't understand how that's possible if you actually care about her the way you *seem* to.
35. "I keep going back and forth between seeing you as Alex, my friend, not just my employee, and as what you appear to be, right now: a woman. A fucking gorgeous one, I might add. The idea that you can be both at once, and more, has been something I've been chewing on., but I didn't think about... the unique ways you've been put at rick. That I've put you at risk." Okay so that's several more points towards the "James is closer to figuring out Alex's gender stuff than she is right now," another point towards the "men stupid blind thoughtless dumbasses" tally as well, and more "Alice is pretty well synced with what these characters are thinking/feeling" points to end it all off. 
36. I see it's Alex's turn to get flustered again, first with trying to understand what "being both 'and more'" could mean and then by having James (seemingly genuinely) express how much he hates the idea of ever hurting her in any way and swearing that he'll never do it again while refusing to let her let him off the hook for it.
37. Yeah the "Miss Brewer" thing was pretty awkward, but actually it might've ultimately been helpful because it seemingly played at least a part in how she ended up being able to properly break the ice with Emily. 
38. Oh and now James is back to gushing about how incredible Alex both looks and is.
39. She's unfortunately still doing her stupid "correcting" thing. I honestly don't believe that the pictures from the play were the only reason you thought of the possibility James. They may have been a seed, but I'm pretty damn sure you've thought more about how pretty she is/would be plenty in the interim. 
40. Ah so James got a bit caught up in everything too thanks in part to Ben's prodding and his concern for Alex. 
41. That "it was always you or no-one" paired with looking away from her has so many potential implications! 
42. Damn right it's fun and incredible seeing a concerningly closed off, quiet, sad "boy" start to break her way out of her shell and grow into her own/who she really is.
43. Oh yeah it's definitely terrifying here and there along the way for that girl. 
44. It really is crazy how natural stuff can start feeling once that initial anxiety falls off. 
45. She's definitely still a bit terrified of trying to take hold of some of the things she wants, that's for sure. In this case one of the big things she's scared of taking a hold of is James, and I think part of the reason for that is that on some level she knows that would lead to her needing to actively think about the other big thing she wants to take a hold of. The fear is enough to make her opt for the serious emotional whiplash that's for sure.
46. The hug as well as the request for reassurance that he'll keep helping her and him confirming that he will to the best of his abilities is really cute.
47. That little kiss on the cheek is probably going to linger on both of your minds for at least the rest of the night.
48. Hey at least she's really acknowledging that she *wants* James, that's a step in the right direction.
49. No James I don't think that is you :3ing her as a friend, you're actually flirting very overtly in fact and :3ing for that same purpose.
50. Yeah trying to force yourself into seeing yourself as a guy will in fact make you feel like less and a bit sick. That's one of the reasons you should stop trying to do that.
51. Not wanting him to see you "like *this*" is yet another bingo tile marked off.
52. Wait weren't you worried about your neighbors seeing you in girl mode? Yet you walked home with your hoodie open and your boobs still attached? You're generationally bad at trying to pass as a guy you know that right Alex.
53. Mirrors are deadly weapons. Fuckers shoot rounds of concentrated dysphoria with at least as much glee as they do with euphoria rounds. 
54. Fuck girl, you help stabilize yourself a bit with the towel and the lipstick and then rip them both away and try to *look* at yourself in an attempt to see if it triggers dysphoria (even thought you almost certainly don't know the word)? That's like bordering on self harm tbh.
55. I might've underestimated Alex's self actualization pace, acknowledging that Girl Alex is "me, through and through, top to toe" is a massive step and it seems like it's probably not going to be the only one she takes tonight.
56. Asking yourself honestly what you are and what you want is really hard. Though your first hypothesis as to both isn't quite right. 
57. This girl has a knack for having very hot dreams, though I wonder if she'll be able to parse the meaning well at all: not at all into things when trying to be a guy, very very very into things when she's a girl.

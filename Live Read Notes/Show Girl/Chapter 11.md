1. Seven in the morning isn't that bad of a time to wake up.
2. Everything I read is going to give me longing huh: "I was going to stay there forever, I decided; I'd never woken up in the embrace of someone I loved before, and I deserved to indulge myself."
3. Lmao, slipping his penis back into his underwear. That's gonna linger on her mind for a while.
4. Unconscious Alex does seem to consistently make good decisions, you should listen to her more Conscious Alex
5. It really is the most natural thing in the world!
6. Damn you bladder! How dare you make her slip out of James' embrace.
7. "I brushed my teeth and pissed at the same time." Alex whyyyyyyyyyyyy????
8. "Maybe I could get fast-tracked for surgery if I told the doctors I really, really hated tucking?" That's unfortunately a bit too much to hope for Alex, especially if you're trying to use the NHS for surgery. 
9. Yep I was pretty sure I was right and Alex would want the thing gone. "Yeah, buddy; your days are *numbered*"
10. Fucking mirrors. You'll be okay Alex!
11. If that's the most insane thing you've ever done Alex then you've done a very low level of insane things.
12. Being able to laugh at yourself is another thing that's really nice.
13. Is this not the first opportunity you've had to stuff your body with estrogen Alex? 
14. Yeah you'll get a ton of girls laughing at you if you tell anyone that you thought about "how convenient it would be for the whole modeling thing if I could my own," before you cracked.
15. Unfortunately the passing concerns are very real safety concerns, though the severity varies depending on environment.
16. Little things like the handfuls of facial hair will unfortunately be a lot more annoying until you're able to get them removed, and you have a path to get there!
17. It's really absurd how much doing some basic skin care can do, I'll always be a bit smug about how much my mom gushed a couple times about how jealous of my skin she'd been lately when I had been on HRT + skincare for a couple months before she found out.
18. Sure James might have the power of size, strength, and money. You however have the power of the guy basically worshipping the ground you walk on, so you're not exactly low on control.
19. Oi why are you going with EV girl? Did the resource site really not teach you better than that?
20. Yes hug the girl when she's feeling nerves and doubts, sometimes it's really all we need.
21. She does have you, Ben, Sophie, most likely Emily, and Vicky too I'd imagine (even if that's less in person going forward) hell of a solid support structure when starting out.
22. Hey "might not have a heart attack" is better than many of us have/expect with our parents, that's not an awful potential starting position.
23. You're fucking right Alex, you are just as real as any other woman, trans or cis.
24. Yeah fully believing it when it comes to yourself is a bit harder.
25. Damn man, getting "cold" when the woman he loves and that loves him is enjoying you being shirtless.
26. Living in the real world is intimidating, however you definitely can handle it especially with your support structure.
27. Yes James, your body is a nice benefit in Alex's eyes, but she loves all of you. Not just your body.
28. Yeah preliminary blood tests are a good idea, having those baseline numbers is potentially useful and can't hurt anything. James also is right that some of the stuff with your appearance is a bit unusual for being 19 and able to pass with relatively little effort.
29. I get the whole thing about feeling like you haven't earned whatever fortune with passing you just happened to roll well on, does a great job of helping yourself make yourself feel really guilty for even wanting ffs or the like despite already looking good to other people.
30. "We can get you on my health plan more or less instantly." To my American brain that sounds very forward (seeing as the only normal way to get someone on your plan in the US is for them to be your spouse, child, or legal ward)
31. If you're ordering the hormones online why the hell are you defaulting to pills Alex?
32. Having someone willing to push you to follow through with what you're wanting to do is invaluable, having a couple people like that in my life lately has helped me advance by leaps and bounds in a tiny fraction of the time it would've otherwise taken me. It is important that they listen if you ask them to pull back a bit though.
33. Being prepared for your penis to make itself annoyingly present can definitely help reduce how distressing it is.
34. Wait you kissed your way down his body towards his crotch and your plan was to give him a hand job after that? 
35. Now that was a solid oral scene, feeling nice and warm inside.
36. "Hey, James, do we have any orange juice? I have this strange taste in my mouth and I have no idea how it got there." Followed by Alex getting pillowed. Dammit that caught me very off guard, I'm laughing so hard that I've got some tears blurring my vision.
37. Okay no I object: beauty blenders are absolutely not inherently "lower level" makeup tech. They're always a useful tool.
38. Perfect timing Ben!
39. Downsides of a nice make out session: your makeup may not survive.
40. Ben this girl was already in an iron eggshell, fortunately iron isn't nearly as durable as people think.
41. No Alex there was no chance you'd be able to sneak you and James past Emily's eyes and insight. 
42. The way you went about telling her about how that ended up happening was really cute. "Bit of a turnaround for Little Miss I'm Not Into Guys, huh?" Yeah just a bit of a turnaround.
43. Smooth subject shift Alex, and a very good choice of subject. I think it'll be very good for you to have Emily around, you need more girl friends and she's clearly very smart and capable..
44. Wow James, a bit in-appropriate banter for you to be engaging in mid-uber ride. Ben and Emily do have the proper responses loaded and in action!
45. Woman to woman sympathy from the Uber driver, 5 stars!
46. "Alex, where were you kissing him that his dick was 'right there'?" See that's basically what I was saying earlier. Thanks Emily, great minds think alike.
47. "Welcome to dating men! Expect aggravation." I do expect intense aggravation, it's one of the reasons that dating men is very unappealing (though it's far from the only reason given my rather tenuous attraction to men in general.) Kicking him when he's being a jerk does sound like a good method.
48. Oh hey here's a great opportunity to put said kicking in action, don't go spilling that much to people James, not even Sophie. Definitely a lot to have to deal with when you're back home though.
49. Moving quick there James, you've been together for less than a day and you're asking her to move in with you? For a straight couple that's pretty dang u-haul of you.
50. Not even slightly a surprise that she'd choose to say yes though.

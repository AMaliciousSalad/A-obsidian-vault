1. Wow she's already recognizing/acknowledging when she's envying other women rather than or instead of being attracted to them.  
2. Can't blame Alex for zoning out for a bit even with James right in front of her, these are some big things she's thinking through.
3. No James you're actually wrong this time, she is a bit of a mess in her head right now. She just doesn't *look* like a mess.
4. James I understand that you really want to know everything about Alex, the things going through her mind, and you're feeling jealous right now so that's intensified; however you do need to let her process things when she asks for that time.
5. Yep Alex you can't force him to say things he's not ready to say either.
6. Back to our regularly scheduled incredibly un-subtle flirting. I really like how Alex is actively trying to make the flirting obvious now though, and I really like how she immediately told him that she hadn't dressed herself for Vicky and that she had done it all herself.
7. And she gets to be walked to the restaurant arm-in-arm!
8. Sophie is definitely not perfect, like it seems like she's trying to be supportive and excited for what she *thinks* is happening but that's very not great for what's actually the case.
9. Hmm, maybe it's worse than that. Not going to make any final judgements right now though.
10. Fucking hell Sophie, have some tact. 
11. Wow that was a lot. So she was trying to be a bit of a jerk, but not for remotely the reason that would make *sense*. Instead it's because she thought that Alex might be some kind of grifter trying to take advantage of James, and she is actually supportive of Alex being a woman. There were a handful of reveals here that I actually didn't predict, actually great subversion that feels fairly targeted towards other trans women as we're fairly primed by default to expect a handful of reasons for certain behavior patterns which can leave us blind to a few others that maybe other people would catch.
12. I do appreciate how overt Sophie is being about making Alex understand exactly how James feels about her and how blatant their interactions have been. 
13. Looking at you like you grew a second head is only natural, you're so obviously already like completely committed to being team girl that that last couple percentage points of actually accepting/internalizing it come off like you're just messing with whoever you're talking to.
14. I don't think Alex will break James' heart either Sophie.
15. Yes please go talk to some trans people, it is legitimately a good idea to do so before things get any more complicated in your head.
16. Unfortunately being 19 (or a lot younger) will not prevent men in their 40s or much older than that from leering at you like that Alex. Sorry about that.
17. Men, men hit on you in the elevator/lift. Sometimes sufficiently drunk women too, but mostly men.
18. Yeah that's definitely one of the downsides, and one of the reasons I almost never do things unless I have at least one friend around (preferably another woman but there are a couple guys that I mostly trust as backup at this point)
19. Yeah just reading posts won't necessarily get you there. Hell even just talking to trans people won't always do it (some people in this server being/having been very convincing examples imo.) Seems like seeing herself just being herself was a big motivator to keep going and try to talk to someone or multiple someones.
20. I like this donut_appreciator guy, very much running on "fuck the EPD" energy and doing a great job with it. Unfortunate that the link doesn't work but I can imagine a couple sites that would make sense after a very obvious button test.
21. Ah yeah basically the same sort of site then, and giving Alex a rundown on the sort of bs that the NHS does to "diagnose" and "treat" you is a great way to help her to just fucking get started instead of worrying about that nonsense.
22. Yeah HRT unfortunately doesn't help with the voice or facial hair, but you've already made absurdly good voice progress and you don't have much facial hair so getting anything else removed shouldn't be too bad for you.
23. I'm hoping that James is just down in the dumps because Alex wasn't flirting with him throughout the rest of dinner and it's not anything worse than that.

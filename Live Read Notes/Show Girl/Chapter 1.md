1. Starting out strong by losing two out of three models a couple days before ~~CES~~ CEE with no backups prepared.
2. And not just no backups prepared: none with available scheduling on such short notice. Oh and potentially with your job on the line.
3. Okay so I see that Brewer's got a bit of an inferiority complex.
4. So a startup funded by daddy's money, and daddy is a classist piece of shit. Well at least James isn't the kind of boss who insists on all the employees be in the office every day, especially not while avoiding working in the office himself.
5. Oh hey similar reasoning as to why I didn't completely hate having to come into the office at my old job: I didn't want to be rotting in the place I was living at the time, which also happened to be my parents' place.
6. Maybe Alex is giving poorly masked attraction more than just an inferiority complex. 
7. James is concerned about Alex, and Alex is thinking about how "booth babes" is a fairly rude and degrading thing to call models but that's what's expected when working with a bunch of men in tech (really when working with men in general)
8. So James doesn't love the idea of trying to draw eyes more with pretty women than what the company has to offer, but unfortunately it's something that works. Especially when on a tight budget. Meanwhile James's father seems to revel in it and make a joke of it because of course he does. At least neither James nor Alex found it funny.
9. How would you possibly fix that problem with software? Your problems are material science as well as the underlying physics and chemistry, the best you can do is try to algorithmically fill in/over the lower quality visual data you'd get through the screen's interference?
10. Okay so the non-Alex and James part of the company seems mostly irrelevant at the moment, honestly that's fine. This doesn't really need to be a "full" work drama cast. 
11. I wonder what James's plan is here. Also getting the dresses the morning of the event is calling things absurdly close.
12. Hmm what sort of person brings luggage over on a couple hours notice? 
13. So the guy is James's best friend and old uni roommate, and is in the room while Alex is about to get some kind of offer and both men pay close attention to Alex.
14. Hopefully James dropping the "booth babe" thing in favor of calling them models will let Alex feel comfortable swapping to that too.
15. So Ben does drag huh.
16. Lol yeah it would be pretty hard to keep up your "serious business proposition" face at that offer, and doubly so worded that way: "James here wants to use *you*"
17. James talking up the reasoning while also just basically drilling in the fact that he thinks Alex would be a beautiful girl. Steam would probably be coming out of more than just my ears in that situation.
18. Okay so it's not just Alex suffering from a barely obscured/not realized crush on James, it's transparently mutual (though I don't know if James is more or less aware of it than Alex). 
19. Reasonable half executed crash out. 
20. Yeah the only person who thinks you're being asked to be a drag queen is you Alex, James clearly said he wanted you to be a beautiful woman, not put on a performance. There's definitely no good reason you wouldn't grasp that, doesn't everyone get asked to become a woman for work reasons?
21. And with the earlier internal comparison to James we've now hit the classic: "I'm not remotely as masculine as I should be as a man, but I'm clearly so incredibly masculine that I couldn't possibly be a woman or anything else."
22. Just came out and directly called Alex pretty too! Moving a bit fast here.
23. FFS "boy" the man is basically begging you the way I imagine he'd beg his girlfriend to step outside her comfort zone, and you just immediately folded. Adorable.
24. Huh I'm actually kinda surprised he hasn't invited you to his apartment before.
25. Holy cow you just dropped a triple shot in a couple gulps?!? That's a lot at once (I am not one to talk in this case, and I'm dumb enough that I've done about the same with vodka/tequila/whiskey instead of something a bit gentler going down)
26. There are definitely drag queens who sport some truly notable beards Alex.
27. Yeah not wanting to be naked in front of anybody for any reason is rather common for us. Also yes waxing is very much not a pleasant sensation, and it gets worse depending on where you're getting it.
28. Toss some nair on now too, sure. Always fun to spin the "chemical burn, insufficient results, or got luck" wheel with that stuff.
29. RIP Alex's cope fuzz, you will almost certainly not be missed.
30. "I'll never do this again." Somehow I strongly doubt that is true.
31. Good old moderately affirming misogyny with the "It's a good thing you're pretty."
32. Padding everywhere huh. Not surprising I guess.
33. True you've gotta learn to take care of your makeup fast if the thing is at the end of the week and you're going to end up being the one doing it.
34. Also this is maintaining the 100% rate for Alyson stories I've read where the impetus for starting to transition was thanks to poor planning and/or mishap.
35. You can make it through to the end of this impromptu makeover Alex, just push through to the end!
36. He had previously asked you to be his date to a wedding???????????
37. Good man, let her see herself for the first time in a proper mirror with proper lighting!
38. Of course you're gorgeous!
39. Oh yeah, voice stuff can make it feel like your wings have just been torn from your back leaving you plummeting towards the sea. I'm sorry about that, it really sucks.
40. My suspension of disbelief is going to be stretched if a gay male drag queen is going to somehow get Alex to a passable voice with a trick or a handful of them.
41. Doesn't even have a visible larynx to worry about???
42. Yes adjusting the resonance is the lions share of the work, but there are so many other little things to keep in mind too. Also who the hell gets a hang of even this first baby step in the first couple attempts like this?
43. Yeah just talking to people is a great way to build up the new stamina and muscle memory. Also "Work? I could talk about work until the cows came home. I loved working with James," is another very cute line.
44. Didn't write it down earlier but dang that was a pretty quick first mention of trans women. 
45. Actually hearing a woman when you speak on day one? I wish, it took me months to hear even a hint to my own ear the first time (though other people had apparently been hearing good bits far before I could). 
46. Yeah with that reaction, even though he thought you were already pretty and could be beautiful he's still been absolutely blown away. That man is probably already all but done for.
47. Yeah I wonder why the pronoun would be hitting you deep in the chest Alex, what could that possibly be about?
48. Yep gotta keep practicing your voice Alex!
49. No can't blame you one bit for being nervous or scared at the prospect of being in the apartment alone with a man like that, even if you really like generally trust the guy.
50. Oh no, getting caught in the blush loop. I can't say I've experienced that (yes I'm still a bit bitter that I can't seem to blush at all.)
51. Yeah Alex you can have this guy completely wrapped around your little finger if you want. Wow.
52. And you immediately demonstrate it a bit with that little finger on the lips move. Nice!
53. Lol the inner voice basically screaming "flirt more! Toy with him!"
54. Dinner! Now that's an idea!
55. Very bold, but I love it!

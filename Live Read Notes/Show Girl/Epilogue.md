1. Leaving being in a different environment and heading back to "home" would be a shock to your system. That offer to move in is probably going to be a big help as it's still another change of environment to make the other changes more comfortable.
2. Seems like the move went remarkably smoothly. 
3. Having time to do nothing but stew in your own thoughts can be pretty awful sometimes. Still try to avoid it as much as possible. 
4. Hey a week and a day or two wait for a laser consultation isn't too bad. Not ideal when you're desperate to start the changes though.
5. Oof yeah the sudden call from the mom is going to throw you off even more. Especially if you get misgendered (despite not being recognized).
6. Getting to show yourself to a parent/parents under your own control and when you're more apparently who you really are would've been nice. Don't think it would've helped much if at all in my case but it would've been nice.
7. Fucking man taking advantage of Alex's mom. Poor Alex feeling the need to misgender herself to her mom too.
8. It's not selfish in the slightest to want the world to leave you alone long enough to get to properly get a start on being yourself. Unfortunately it's another one of those things that's much easier to say to other girls than it is to apply it to yourself.
9. Yay the hormones shipped! Still should've done injections if you're going diy rather than going for pills but whatever.
10. Yay hiring Emily already went through! Alex going to the office and helping her get set up (and just get to spend more time with another woman) is good for her.
11. Aggressive hugs are wonderful!
12. A whole month in comfy shoes, that's the dream right there.
13. Sounds like James plans to have Alex be one of the executives or maybe a co-owner going forward. 
14. Not having any trouble at the sandwich shop is a good sign.
15. Damn, guess Alex isn't going to get to come out to Emily in quite the controlled manner she wanted.
16. Emily not blowing up or anything so far is a good sign, gonna keep my fingers crossed.
17. Yay Emily continues not to disappoint me! I knew I trusted her for good reasons. Can't blame her for breaking down laughing for a bit, Alex's story over the last week is really quite funny.
18. I don't believe many trans girls came out to themselves while "modeling a bloody dress on a bloody stand at a bloody trade show" either Emily. Our Alex has a fairly unique story compared to most.
19. Childhood plays sure have a way of changing your life in all sorts of ways, kissing a girl for the first time at a rehearsal is really cute Emily.
20. Woo Emily getting her to fast track the Prog!
21. And advocating for injections! Now this is a real ally. 
22. "A discussion server for British trans people her age" you say? Sounds like a certain consensus server that appears in at least one other excellent story that I'm aware of.
23. Ooh her own not quite LBD (as those are usually mini length not maxi) and a nice dinner with a intent of no interruptions/distractions. Now that's a nice surprise.
24. Whoa that's basically just a full on proposal you just dropped in the girl's lap James, you might really burn out her brain with that if you're not careful.
25. Glad to hear coming out at work went smoothly Alex.
26. Poor Alex, put out on stage like that for Ben's audience. The "who wants her genes" thing is reminding me of a couple of comments some of my friends have made about my legs/hips.
27. Lmao, with my harping on doing injections I'm basically just being one of the "trans youth UK" server members now.
28. Yay she stayed in touch with Vicky, and it seems like Vicky might've found a really nice girl!
29. Alex getting an un-official offer to be a bridesmaid is wonderful! I can hardly wait the remaining month till I get to be one and I'm so happy for Alex getting to do the same.
30. Big sis Emily has effectively adopted Alex! 
31. Emily makes novelty mugs now does sheâ€¦.
32. Alex being the HR department might be a conflict of interest.
33. "They were more like comfort tits" that's so cute.
34. I really hope that Alex does get to be her mother's daughter properly.
35. Kinda stressful proposal that James has handed to Alex, but it seems pretty well thought out.
36. Cleaning everything is a good way to burn time when you're feeling anxious about something that's about to happen.
37. Yeah the hair removal can really fuck with your skin a bit, at least that's only temporary.
38. I'm so fucking happy for Alex, her mom accepted her for real it seems.
39. Add another trans protag who I'm very envious of having one or more parents supporting them to the pile.
40. Why did my parents and so many other of the people in my closely related family have to be so shit?
41. At least it's a small comfort that any time I have to be near them I can be pretty confident they'll be the ones who look insane if they try to give me grief.
42. Sophie might've worried me initially but I kinda adore her now. The stealth measurements for the dress are pretty funny, reminds me of stories about trying to measure ring sizes in the night (wouldn't be surprised if James did that too)
43. The joys of having girl friends/sisters to hype you up and put some of your fears to rest.
44. If James' mom is worried about Alex's safety when just showing up as a girl in this situation she's going to really freak if/when she hears the full story.
45. Fuck, guess Alex would be properly unlucky with at least one parent.
46. I really want/need to work on being able to get properly loud in my voice. 
47. Henry might be a bit gross but I can't hate him when he's yelling at Alex's dad on her behalf.
48. There's something nice about the idea of actually having resources backing up a trans woman in protecting herself and her mother from a man instead of piled into trying to ruin her life if not flat out kill her for once.
49. Ah thanks for reminding me that you're a bit of a pig with that framing of the idea of having a surrogate Henry.
50. Yeah James that sure is a family you've got there. Same with you Alex.
51. I wonder if Alex's cousin is anyone of note of if it's just that James is having fun teasing her.
52. Oh cool a Bee shoutout at the end of the book in the acknowledgements.

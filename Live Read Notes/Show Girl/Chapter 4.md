1. Good girl, washing your underwear is important.
2. It can be pretty crazy how much time seems to start meaning something once you start transitioning and don't mostly just want the day to be over all day every day.
3. Make sure to send James the bill for you cleaning up his place.
4. No Alex I don't think most maids are cleaning in just underwear and heels
5. And there's Ben with even more stuff!
6. Ben thinks he can give her proper hair extensions, go shopping, and get back to the office in whatever under 2 hour time they have before the other model gets there??? Good luck!
7. I wonder what those emotional reasons that doing this is a bad idea are.
8. Being worried about being asked to model frequently is a fairly reasonable concern I guess.
9. "I will face my dress. I will not permit it to pass over me. I will throw it in the trash and run away to watch sport with people who sweat a lot" wow you sound so enthusiastic about that potential line of thought there Alex
10. Okay so they aren't trying to make her get back to the office before the other model shows up, that's good.
11. I wonder why you don't like the idea of James talking to the other model on his own, could it be because you're a tad jealous and possessive?
12. Still even 2.5 hours is a pretty short time period for a full head of hair extensions. Though I guess it depends a bit on the method.
13. Sure "thanks, I grew it myself" may be a well trodden line, but it's still a good one! It's even more fun when you get to use them for your boobs and the like.
14. Ah and they won't be trying to shop in person now either. Kinda sad but you do still need to get back to the office to cover anything that James misses when it comes to bringing the other model up to speed.
15. Bonded extensions in 2.5 hours? I'd expect at minimum 3-3.5 for the level of quality and the amount of extensions she's likely to be getting.
16. Maybe with 2 people working at it it's just a lot faster. I don't remember if the girls I know who've had bonded extensions done had multiple people working on them right now.
17. Waking up again to nearly immediately get gendered correctly! Gonna be honest girl, unless Ben outed you I'd be very surprised if they had any idea about your "real" gender
18. Alex don't hurt the poor stylists like that! Not that I actually expect you to want to remove them by the time the event ends, but damn girl that's harsh.
19. Lol didn't even make it more than a couple steps out the door before you wanted to keep them.
20. I should try some subtle acrylic nails one of these days. 
21. So yes, this "uber driver treated me like a woman while being nice: 5 stars!" is definitely going to continue to recur. I hope it doesn't get twisted at some point by a driver clocking her and being a piece of shit to her as a result.
22. Girl is really ending up with designer clothes just off the rip, good for her. Though she should probably get some cheaper stuff too for more casual use.
23. "I think, actually, this whole thing is the last thing I want." You would be very wrong in that case.
24. No Ben she isn't gay, but she's still very obviously into James.
25. "What's a 'cis' woman?" Lol. Ben I know her level of density is frustrating, but please don't kill her.
26. The girl watched several videos for trans women relating to both voice training and makeup but somehow didn't manage to think "I wonder what this funny adjective means??????"
27. Ben, she's clearly not even slightly cognizant of gender stuff/terminology beyond running on instinct, you're just going to drive yourself crazy trying to explain things if you keep relying on said terms.
28. Wow you cut off your fantasizing about wearing cute outfits to work every day even faster than I expected.
29. If you think the clothes are expensive wait till you find out that the extensions were probably at minimum a grand too. You've just had probably the better part of 4-5k spent on you Alex
30. I don't think for a moment that telling Ben that James thought you looked beautiful in the maxi dress the night before would give him anything resembling the wrong idea.
31. Yeah I guess it's fair that we get little reminders here and there that she's been consistently dysphoric in the past instead of just getting "oops all euphoria." Still not being able to look yourself in the mirror without being covered up does drag up some bad memories.
32. Like I can tell that most of Alex pushing back and/or complaining is just her feeling obligated to deny herself before "giving in" and doing it because in part she really wants to, but I still don't love how pushy Ben and James are being with her at times.
33. Yes thank you for asking her permission before just starting on the makeup. It's the bare minimum though so I won't be thanking you in the future
34. She's definitely worried about any sort of permanence here (though lobe piercings in particular will heal up real quick like nothing happened if you remove the piercing and let them so even that's not particularly permanent.)
35. Wow a normal taxi! I don't know if I've ever used one.
36. Ben is right you know: you're capable, beautiful, charming, at minimum a competent programmer, and James is completely smitten with you. Doesn't matter how much you think that's impossible.
37. Go be amazing Alex! You’re not beating the bit of a cheeky girl allegations with that little kiss on the cheek though.
38. James is apparently very cheeked up himself lol
39. Hey you don’t *have* to be quite this dressed up every day Alex, there are plenty of more casual but good looking office ready outfits for women. Definitely not as easy as it is for guys though, trade off being that they don’t get almost any fun clothes meant for them.
40. Somehow I don’t think this “be constantly annoyed with him” strategy is going to be an effective one to bury the crush under for any real length of time.
41. You might’ve felt like the one being ambushed here but you’ve gone and reversed it quite successfully, out the gates swinging by teasing him about having trouble with the vending machine and he’s so stunned by you that he drops his phone!
42. She’s such a little shit, I love it.
43. Gender euphoria with a side of spending time with and teasing the person you like does sound like a combo that would be nice to bottle and have on hand for whenever you might want/need it.
44. The idea of James walking around in a daze at the expo because he saw Alex is very very funny.
45. Yep, better take the elevator, she’s in heels and a cute skirt and is new to both, stairs is a bit of a big ask for her right now.
46. Oh no, she’s so beautiful that it burned James’ brain out almost completely. 
47. Oh the tremendous moron somehow doesn’t realize Alex is completely infatuated with him too
48. Okay well your problems with dating women are probably two fold: you’ve previously only dated straight women and they generally don’t click romantically or sexually with other women, and I’ve yet to see any indication that you’re attracted to women either.
49. Yeah that would be a big mood ruiner. 
50. I hate that he made her uncomfortable like that again, and I’m so very glad she’s found the confidence to tell him the fuck off about it. One of the downsides of men that you really like and who like you too is that at the end of the day they’re still *men*. 
51. I guess on top of standing up for herself and telling James of another upside is that as a result she’s at least partially realized she hates trying to be “Boy Alex” and fill his role in the world.
52. You probably should’ve stopped and kicked him for calling you a bitch like that

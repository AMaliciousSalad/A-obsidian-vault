1. At the end of the last chapter she collapses into James's bed while noting that she can smell him on it and she's dreaming about him now!
2. That's actually a pretty good combo for a suit. Kinda super villain-ish but a solid combo.
3. Whoa girl. That's one extremely horny dream. I'm buzzing a bit too after that.
4. Yeah that was a very *wet* dream you had there. I hate that you're feeling shame about everything right now though.
5. She's not feeling the best about everything right now. Can't blame her, it was a lot all in one day.
6. Listen to Girl Alex, she's the smarter one!
7. Lol yeah the most common type of glue for wigs is just that easy to take off (alternate options are around if a wig needs to be able to stay on through lots of water or soap and water iirc)
8. Ben is quite funny.
9. Hey speaking from experience you can be simultaneously be very smart and very very very dumb and/or dense! 
10. So not her first time wearing women's clothes then. I wonder what the first was (or maybe I just missed it)
11. Ben really drilling in that she's a dumbass and he hadn't even heard that they went out together yet!
12. Yeah not a chance you'll ever get to take that slip of the tongue back, and you dug yourself into an even deeper hole because you've given him all he needs to realize you stayed the night!
13. Girl you've gotta watch out, these gay guys are nothing if not gossip hounds. You let that sort of thing slip and he'll be pestering you about it forever.
14. "I smiled at how peaceful he look, before remembering that this was the guy who'd stolen my clothes and dressed me as a woman and taken me out and kissed me and had, therefore, committed a terrible crime against my equilibrium." Aww you like him so much! Also while he may have really fucked your equilibrium he's also basically catapulted you who knows how far ahead in the self-actualization timeline you might've otherwise had so he deserves to sleep peacefully and you'll be very glad for it down the line!
15. So Ben did mess up a bit with the wig instructions and/or soap so she'll have an excuse to jab back at him a bit! Wigs can just be that easy to remove though, probably really builds on that whole feeling of being a bit of a dumbass right now.
16. No don't go trying to break that good habit that you've somehow managed to start developing in one night (assuming she did only start developing that habit that night and hasn't just realized that it's been her habit for a while now or something). 
17. And getting gendered correctly by a random uber driver even when you probably look like a bit of a mess! Good for you love, good for you.
18. Remind me to never use "love" that way again, even as a joke, feels wrong coming out of my mouth or from the tips of my fingers.
19. She's a bit freaked out about the gendering, but doesn't want to ruin it either eh.
20. Blissfully free of James-shaped distractions she thinks mere moments to minutes before being very tempted to call him. Probably because she wants to hear his voice, which is adorable.
21. Ugh yeah getting misgendered over the phone sucks.
22. Yeah that squawking sounds like you might've overdone it a bit last night there Girl Alex, you went from (probably) never having done that with your voice before to keeping it up for several hours. The muscles that control where your larynx is located are probably worn out right now.
23. Yeah that's a whole storm of dysphoria and anxiety and fear hitting her now. Poor thing. Hopefully James slows down enough to listen and help her through it.
24. Great job James, letting her have some space and time to rest properly while showing that you value her above everything else it pretty much the perfect way to handle all of this.
25. I also notice he hasn't gendered her as anything but a girl or resorted to the good old "just use her name instead" method since the pizza place.
26. Girl Alex's voice is your voice because you are Girl Alex you bimbo. She's not a separate entity or a what if, she's just you and what you want.
27. No don't try to suppress "her" that's just you trying to suppress yourself.
28. Ah so she has singing experience, that can help as long as you don't mental block yourself for a while like I did (well it can help after you get out of the block, too)
29. No don't get into a rant how much I despise "classical" singing terminology. I'll just say that the only difference between "head voice" and "falsetto" is that what people think of when they think "falsetto" is just the result of either an undertrained or an intentionally exaggerated M2 voice. 
30. Okay based on that "You sound great! Exactly like you, um, should," the way he's been dancing around gendering her since last night, and some of his behavior that same night I think James is probably much closer to understanding that she just is Girl Alex than she is right now.
31. He's really not confident in telling her what he wants to: that she doesn't look like a kid, she looks like a woman.
32. Yes he did deserve to be told off for having Ben take her clothes. It may have turned out well or even for the better, but doing anything like that without her consent is wrong and he shouldn't have done it. Even if he still thought she was a guy when he came up with the idea.
33. FFS Alex, every time he gets up the nerve to tell you that you look like the woman you are even without wearing all the other stuff you interrupt him before he can finish. Then he chickens out the next time, and you just loop!
34. Yeah, there are definitely some problematic power dynamics involved and like I said the decision to steal her clothes was wrong. The fears about losing her job are definitely in the book version as well. Though I will say that her fears about losing her job are seemingly 100% unfounded and "just" her catastrophizing because she didn't/doesn't have much if any self esteem, at least at the point I am in the story I'm pretty sure he'd be deeply disturbed by the idea that she thinks he'd ever fire her.
35. Come on man, don't put her on the spot like that. She just got her voice back and putting her on the phone is a big ask. At least she is genuinely really good when it comes to dealing with people. Her "bullshit generator" basically didn't have to actually do anything there though, it's just that she didn't correct or affirm Hammond's gendering in the email rather than just not correcting them.
36. Really not the time to flirt James. You're chaining dumb to bad to once again borderline agency striping decisions now the moment after I defend you on the read that you wouldn't ever intentionally let Alex think you'd fire her over any of this model stuff.
37. Don't like how much they're trying to force into being done in a 2 hour time period. Also don't love having to think about dynamics and the like right now as I was hoping to just have a nice fun read after getting through Kimmy. Fuck me I'm making a "why is everything political/why can't I just have pure escapism" argument now huh.
38. Ben being her gopher for the event is pretty funny, I wonder if she'll have some fun with that as payback for making fun of her over the text messages.
39. Yep, having normal girl clothes to wear is important for at least the off time at the event.
40. Well one more thing that's popping out to me as evidence that I'm tired is that I'm having trouble right now telling what exactly the "Alex" vs "Girl Alex" dynamic is right now. I'm pretty sure this is just her trying to forcibly compartmentalize rather than that she is/was plural.
41. Ignoring that for the moment: "The key to James' flat!" internal gushing is really cute!
42. Well there fully drops any remaining tiptoeing around what pronouns James thinks are appropriate for referring to Alex, at least when it comes to over the phone. Still a bit overwhelming for her thought it seems.
43. Is "uber driver treated me as a woman in 'x' way/situation without being a creep about it: 5 stars" going to be the big recurring gag of this book?

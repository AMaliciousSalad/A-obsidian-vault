1. Fuck, poor girl. 
2. Getting up and doing something is better than just wallowing in aftermath of nightmares seemingly fueled by dysphoria and that fear of what people might and sometimes do do to us.
3. At least she's able to clean herself up a bit at the gym at work. 
4. No, trying to ignore it all is a completely awful idea.
5. Well at least you're bad at ignoring it, can't seem to do it to how much you really don't want James to see a man/boy/not a woman when he looks at you.
6. Sorry Alex, but Future Alex is also very much Girl Alex and she's definitely not a "him".  
7. You acknowledge you want to claim "woman" even if it's hard to do so, but that doesn't even tip you off huh.
8. Yeah our faces are consistently one of the hardest things for us to deal with and/or judge fairly.
9. Girl idk how you possibly thought you had that much self-control. All of yours is pretty pre-occupied with trying to hold back on jumping James.
10. "Forever grateful to my parents for choosing a name that was plausibly unisex, as if they knew I would turn out to be a massive dumbass." It's always nice when your parents give you at least one nice and/or useful thing in your life.
11. A nice un-eventful run to the store for some makeup supplies. 
12. Ben is quite a bit more useful than "God"
13. Yeah I don't think it'll take much effort to have James seeing you the right way, hell I mostly doubt he can see you as a guy without active effort anymore if even then.
14. Good for you girl! That's one thing you're done denying, hopefully those steps you took last night won't stall out and you'll be able to stop denying the other thing soon too.
15. And being honest about having a rough night and morning! All very good steps in the right direction.
16. Hmm I wonder where she imagined him entering her, like I have an assumption but I guess I don't know for sure.
17. Now that's a big outpouring of honest feelings. You're really doing a bad job of ignoring *everything* and seem to have mostly swapped to trying to only ignore the one remaining elephant the size of Jupiter that's in the room, and to be honest that's a particularly scary elephant so I can't be too hard on you about that.
18. Still not quite ready to face whatever potentially really insightful questions she thinks James might ask her yet.
19. Poor guy is still a bit lost as to what she wants him to think of her and what he should think of her, but at least he was able to work out that being honest and telling he that she looks great is the right move!
20. Nice, they're getting to spend some time just being friends! Very nice.
21. Well maybe not "just" being friends considering the extra physical touch based flirting.
22. Yep the feelings really can/do get so much more deep and intense when you're not completely denying yourself or being muted by a wall of dysphoria anymore.
23. Seems like James has at least partially decided to stop denying some of his reaction to his attraction to Alex, at least if the flirting and the little touch on the neck as he was on his way out to get the dresses.
24. And standing up for herself about what to wear for the trip over! Good going girl!
25. She's already getting a friend laughing at her when she's worried something she's wearing might be giving "guy/boy." The speedrun continues.  
26. Ben is addressing one of the things now, and Alex is following through with not denying that thing any more. And she's so cute about it too, though you're both wrong it's actually baby straight. You're right, she does have it bad.
27. That may be when you started to be aware of it, but definitively not when it actually started. 
28. "She writes code *and* poetry!" that's another bingo spot.
29. Ah and there's the realization that the attraction is in fact not a new thing that's happened over the last two days. 
30. Yes James is definitely straight. That also only matters here as a potential clue about who/what Alex is, James is obsessed with her anyway. 
31. Aww, the flood of messages worrying about Alex is adorable. The pronoun thing is also pretty cute. "Gender hard, sex easy; put penis in now?" lmao
32. For someone who seems fairly aware of gender stuff I'm not sure if Ben is just playing dumb or proving that even if they're aware of and support us cis folks are still shit at actually considering that someone might be one of us unless the person just comes out and says it themselves.
33. Wow she's actually considering that she might have a chance! And both herself and Ben are so much more pessimistic about her "chances" than reality indicates.
34. You're that unsteady after a 2 hour drive? Try a non-stop 4-5 hour drive and then come back to me.
35. Yeah can't blame you for not wanting to talk about *everything* with the other two random employees around.
36. It is nice when guys *offer* to do nice things for you, it sours if they refuse to listen if you turn them down though.
37. Ah James slipped up a bit with the extra hotel room cancelations. 
38. I've done the "5+ people staying in a hotel room meant for 2-maybe 4" several times in my life. You've just gotta be a bit careful.
39. What the fuck James!?! You've already gone and broken the "I'll never hurt you again" promise by being a dumbass.
40. Okay based on that gasp from Ben he might just be playing dumb to at least some extent.
41. Fuck, I can feel this poor girl choking on dysphoria right now.
42. Poor thing is starting to associate "Alex" with whatever it might currently be a shortened version of rather than as referring to her.
43. Okay so Ben was just playing dumb?
44. Or maybe hearing James say *that* and seeing Alex's reaction was the lynchpin?
45. But yeah like I said: trying to just ignore this was never going to work, so it's good that Ben is trying to help walk her through this.
46. Yeah thinking through why *that* hurt you so much is not going to be fun — even though it'll probably be very good for helping you finally realize — because you still believe that *that* is true about you.
47. "I'd never felt real in my life. Not until… Not until James looked at me" oh you poor baby girl.
48. No you're running down the wrong thought process, this isn't just "this could be James reminding himself of what I 'really am'" or some shit. 
49. Yes that's what Ben is implying. Now why don't you think that could be true? Lol no "cis" does not actually stand for "comfortable in skin." 
50. No Alex, we don't always really know and always knowing certainly isn't the defining characteristic about us by any means, hell as far as I can tell kids like me who knew early on are quite possibly a minority and by a lot (no I'm not counting people who realized after figuring it out that they've felt everything since they were young too in this particular total).
51. You don't *need* to feel a visceral hatred for your body, but uh you're definitely an example of someone who hates their body. People don't disassociate away from their bodies the way you're describing doing unless they can't bare to think about it.
52. No that's not right Alex. Please don't hurt yourself like this with all the denial and stuff.
53. Fuck, please listen to Ben. You really do need to talk about this, Ben I really wish you were better at this. You need to stop beating around the bush so much and just ask her the obvious important questions outright like: "why don't you think you could be trans?"
54. Dammit.
55. Oh did she have the tailors size it to almost exact waist circumference? That can definitely get a bit un-comfy when you eat or get a bit bloated or the like.
56. Slits are fun Alex! Though yeah for an event where half your responsibility is to actively let men ogle you I can't blame you for regretting that choice a bit.
57. I don't think you're actually good, but okay Alex.
58. Oh yeah it would've been awkward if you were the only company to have models
59. No hats almost certainly would've been tacky for your company's intended vibe. Also stop putting yourself down, you look absolutely fantastic too Alex!
60. No he does need to apologize, you might be trying to suppress this but he absolutely did hurt you with what he said.
61. Okay yes the stewardess hats are really cute, but I still hold that they would've been the wrong move for your company's purposes.
62. "Go home and never think about this ever again." Okay first of all that's totally a healthy thought process and definitely not a massive indicator that you're not okay right now and really need to think about it more, also and indication that you can't pull this suppression thing off.

1. I sure hope James knows for certain that Alex likes Marmite, otherwise that's a pretty awful choice of toast spread to default to.
2. This girl has had night after night of extremely horny dreams, I don't know how she has the self control to not be jumping the guy at this point with how pent up she seems to be.
3. "A vulgar, excitable, hungry side of me had awoken after being asleep my whole life, and it wanted to be *fucked*." Yeah welcome to the club, though at least you literally have your dream fuck right in front of you.
4. "How much more convenient it would be to grow my own! If they were real, they probably wouldn't try to escape." Somehow despite thinking this stuff Alex is totally going to deny that she's a girl/woman/trans at least one more time isn't she. 
5. Now James we both know that this just woken up girl doesn't need to say anything more than "Hi" to make your morning.
6. Such a tragedy, gained coffee but lost that not quite skin contact in the process.
7. That voice training muscle memory sure has grabbed hold hard really quickly. Good for her.
8. The man is gushing about how he loves looking at you so much that he can barely bring himself to drag himself away long enough to get some of the prep for the day handled and you're somehow going to continue denying that he's obsessed with you too.
9. Oh good she did follow through with contacting at least one of James' exes, and got a reply. Nothing too bad either, at least not for Alex seeing as she's busy with the same things that've made James a bit absent in previous relationships.
10. This reminds me: I really need to finish playing Half Life: Alyx. Great game in the parts I've played so far, and actually fairly terrifying in the dark sections.
11. Just constant flirting, I almost feel like I should be giving them privacy instead of reading this.
12. Also: damn I wish tucking for a night or two was sufficient to disable the stupid things. Can't be that lucky though.
13. Well you don't know better Alex, I guarantee you that he's intentionally showing off.
14. Well Alex, there are a couple options to help with the physical discomfort you're getting while tucking. One's an improvement, one's a complete solution, and I doubt you'll have any trouble with being able to afford either if you're interested thanks to having James. Based on how you talk about not liking to interact with your current genitals I expect you'll want it.
15. Good job Ben, the girl needed a hug.
16. Jelly babies help with preventing a dry throat?
17. Damn I want someone to want me and to want someone as much as these two want each other
18. I wonder what Emily thinks of the fact that Alex said she doesn't like guys at this point, she can obviously tell Alex likes likes James after all.
19. Yeah what is James' cousin doing here now?
20. At least she doesn't seem to have noticed anything yet. And Alex is feeling protective of Ben's job with the makeup which is cute.
21. So she just got bored and decided to show up then.
22. Well that's unfortunate timing from Emily, now Alex has a potential bomb to defuse.
23. Well Sophie isn't quite being a nightmare yet, though she's sure not shy about asking a ton of questions.
24. Hilarious that Alex took her asking about Alex not seeming to be uncomfortable "acting" as a woman as being about dealing with men.
25. There's a bit of an ick with Sophie thinking this is basically just Alex doing drag, but at least she's chill for now.
26. Lol Sophie is having fun fucking with James about this. Can't blame Alex from wanting to collapse with exhaustion after she headed to lunch with James though.
27. For fucks sake, the poor girl can't seem to stop running into people who she knows. 
28. Well at least Vicky didn't really do anything but ask Alex to chat with her, with a reschedule for the evening after she explained that she can't immediately. 
29. I believe the day is only like half way done at most and Alex has had exhausting things happen one after the other, poor girl is going to be so tired by the end of the day, much less by the time she has that chat at the bar with Vicky and then goes to dinner with James and Sophie.
30. I hate that James isn't wrong that being careful about that meeting with Vicky is a good idea. Also okay then I wasn't wrong that James had probably read her "affirmative noises" last night as her agreeing with what he said. He absolutely seems to think that Alex is a trans woman (correct) and that she's both aware of it and basically confirmed it to him (not correct)
31. At least chatting with Emily helped her calm down and get her mind off the more concerning things for a bit.
32. Alex you are absolutely authentic. 
33. "I vowed to practice when we got back to London" I thought you were planning on going back to being "Boy Alex" after the show. Your actual thoughts/desires keep slipping through when you're not on guard for them.
34. Yeah I can understand the feeling that relying on prosthetics and the like to fill out parts of your appearance would make you feel artificial, it's part of the reason I could never bring myself to try any of the same type of stuff and just waited for the HRT and exercise and the like to do the work before I tried anything cute. It had already hurt enough when I stopped looking even convincingly androgynous when I snuck wearing stuff in my teens and I couldn't bear seeing "a guy in a dress" in the mirror again in any way.
35. Okay did she remember more of what James said and how she responded last night than I thought or is she just so anxious about this meeting that she's all but completely lost her mental walls about ending this forever after this weekend?
36. Okay so Vicky definitely doesn't think that Alex is any sort of guy, and she's talking to her like any other girl and Alex is feeling like a deceiver/liar about it. I still get that, at social events I keep on feeling like I have to come out to every group of women I'm spending time with when it feels like they're treating me just a little too nicely or I'm being deceptive too.
37. Holy shit Alex is finally getting to learn that not all trans people know from the time they're really young.
38. Yeah that would be a monumental realization wouldn't it. Just completely shatters her main excuses for denying herself. 
39. I feel like such a cliche sometimes: actually properly knew when I was young, absolutely crippling dysphoria throughout almost my entire life, and stumbled on what's damn near a "every other trans girl" name right now. I'm the only trans person I've met irl that's even remotely this close to that stereotypical architype.
40. Holy shit she fucking said it! Sure it's qualified with an "I think", but holy shit!
41. And all her rationalizations are falling apart. Because yeah she does love being treated like a woman and it makes her feel like a real person for the first time.
42. Yes you were being a little dense the last couple days baby girl, but that happens to pretty much everyone. Hell I might be a self styled cliche but I still managed to almost completely convince myself I was wrong after well over a decade of trying to bury it in an attempt to survive my family.
43. Lol, can't blame Vicky for thinking that Alex was saying she might be a trans man. Poor Alex feeling she had to call herself "A boy. A guy. A man." Sure it might've made it a bit more clear to Vicky but it's ultimately just Alex hurting herself at least one last time.
44. Thank you Vicky, don't let the poor think talk/think/etc. herself back into the closet!
45. Yeah enjoying a strategy meeting is an achievement impossible for human kind, at least as long as it actually ends up being a proper strategy meeting and doesn't turn into something moderately entertaining.

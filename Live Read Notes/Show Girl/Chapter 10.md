1. If nothing else he's definitely scaring Alex with how despondent he's being right now.
2. Okay so yes it's about what Sophie was worried about earlier and Alex pulling back a bit during dinner. However instead of thinking for a moment that Sophie was right back then instead he's worrying that he's been forcing Alex into things that she really really wasn't willing to do and he just forced her into doing them anyway. 
3. He is right to be feeling bad about the clothes thing from the first day/night, and for spending more on making her up than on actually paying her. 
4. Letting him tear down his ego a bit is a good thing imo, might help a bit with some of the power dynamic problems going forward, however it's not good if he starts rejecting who Alex really is because he thinks she's just trying to make him feel better or something like that.
5. I'm honestly not sure how much of the things James is saying he would've done if Alex hadn't called him out are just intrusive thoughts or not. Still it's not bad to put them out in the open, being honest especially about things like this is very important for a healthy relationship.
6. The spiraling he's starting isn't good for either of them though. 
7. Okay now Alex is taking the initiative and trying to snap him out of it, telling him some of the big things that Sophie had asked her is a big move to make him stop and listen. Now she has to keep going and make the rest clear to him too.
8. Another big messy spilling of feelings, made my heart race reading it. But she fucking said it, no "I think" or "probably" or any other qualifier. She just said, "I'm trans. Transgender. I'm a transgender woman. I'm a trans woman." She fucking owned it and she told *him* at the same time!
9. Oi James no rejecting her being herself out of guilt. I said not to do that earlier.
10. Okay so he didn't take last night as her confirming things to him. I'm very very very confused by the "male fail" he used to describe her earlier though.
11. James you're such a jerk, you had the girl have to come out and spill everything about how much she's been fantasizing about you for the last few days to get it through your thick skull that if there's anything you don't need to feel guilty about it's falling for and fantasizing about her. Hopefully now you'll believe her when she says "James. I'm a woman. And I'm in love with you."
12. Lmao, laughing isn't the reaction that was on the top of my list, but it was in the top 5 because a lot like crying it can be a very good way to just release a ton of emotion at once.
13. They sure are a pair of immensely dense idiots. It's fucking adorable.
14. Oh thank goodness they're actually going to fucking do something instead of just tiptoeing around each other now that they know it's all mutual. Of course it would have to be Alex initiating and leading the way for most of it, she is the one who has him wrapped around her finger after all so she's at least mostly in charge even if she's a bit nervous about it all.
15. Ah yeah I should've expected that dysphoria would flare up when the sexual stuff started feeling real. That same stupid trigger set me off the only I ever did anything particularly physical with anyone, and really dampened how much I was able to enjoy any of it. If nothing else it's a pretty good way to become certain that you really really want bottom surgery.
16. Dammit I'm crying because this is reminding me of a lot of my hangups.
17. Okay so he did do some research
18. Maybe I'm projecting a bit about how much she might want "the surgery" but I'd be surprised if the level of discomfort she has with it right now ends up going away with HRT (or even going down, for me it got a lot worse as the rest of me got closer to feeling right.)
19. I get the feeling of being concerned about letting James have more power over her with the financial help, but damn if I had someone willing/able to pay for the transition stuff I need/want I don't think I'd be able to turn it down outside of some really absurd conditions being attached.
20. The man is having fun being a tease now too, even less subtlety now with just walking in wearing only boxers.
21. Fucking mirrors. The things still get me fairly often. 
22. Good job just telling her how you feel to pull her out of letting dysphoria make her feel insecure. Spooning as you fall asleep sounds so nice.

1. "My womanhood might have been disposable and very recently acquired" Very recently acquired maybe, disposable though? I don't believe that for a moment.
2. I think at this point I can swap to she/herring her more freely, rather than relying on just calling her Alex.
3. Yeah that dress is probably a bit much for a casual dinner date.
4. The moment you start to realize a part of who you really that fear of losing it can be intense. Just hold on a bit Alex, you'll be okay
5. She is so very smitten isn't she. She's also pretty damn tough if she's feeling like she might be read to appear in public already.
6. Him being "more charismatic" than you might not last long, though getting people to respect you properly as a charismatic woman is harder than for a charismatic man.
7. Yeah you don't need to go for the Michelin star restaurants already. A more casual dining location is plenty for a first date that you haven't realized is a date.
8. Going to the right bathroom is really fucking scary at least the first time. It got a lot easier for me after that first time.
9. She's running with trying to satisfy the taxi driver by calling this a date, when that's just exactly what it is. So she's not even having to lie even if she thinks she is.
10. James, man I get that you're having a crisis as you're at some level realizing that girl Alex is real but you can't be zoning out on her like that.
11. Yes be a gentleman and lend her your jacket! Good boy!
12. Yeah just rub it in that you're already almost completely girl shaped and you haven't even started hrt or anything yet. (It's been so fucking weird discovering that I can basically be engulfed in clothes I used to just normally wear and fit.)
13. Also awwwwwwwwww, that image of them walking across the street like that!
14. Nope you mis-corrected yourself when you swapped from saying "the other woman" to just "the woman." Stop that.
15. Yeah you're mostly taking to this like a fish to water. That's probably a significant portion of why he's so incredibly nervous and concerned.
16. Yep he's still reeling from how beautiful you are and how natural you are about it. 
17. Yep he did call you pretty back in the office before he'd really been able to see you anything like this, isn't that wonderful!
18. Is Alex maybe the rare egg/transfic protag that's not the bottom of the relationship? She sure seems to be taking most of the lead so far, even if she basically melts at any of James's requests.
19. Yeah that fear of having people hurt you is unfortunately very bad at listening to reassurances or getting out of your mind.
20. That "even if I wanted to" sure did make it into that sentence didn't it.
21. Yeah the idea of James acting the way he normally would on dates might be a bit embarrassing, but you clearly like the idea too Alex
22. Come on girl, this is easy. That other half of him really really likes you and wants you, it's (probably) just that simple
23. The man is doing mental gymnastics trying to figure out what to think about how he's feeling right now and you're taking the chance to tease and flirt. Genuinely stunning performance, you're a natural!
24. "I don't remember" his pants have such an inferno coming off them that the tips of the flames are higher than the tip of Everest.
25. Not surprising that you've basically had a neon sign surrounding you saying "hey this is a girl," for years now. Are you trying to pull off blackout win on an "egg bingo" card? 
26. Fuck, yeah you really need to get those measurement to the tailor!
27. Oi Alex stop it with these "corrections" you keep getting it right and then changing it to something else. Yes James just got your pronouns right in general not just "right for tonight", and yes the other woman was in fact another woman not "the woman"
28. These two are really cute.
29. Considering that based on your naming scheme yes you're not "Alex", you're girl Alex. It would only make sense that he looked at you like you're girl Alex instead of "Alex."
30. Still can't blame the girl for being nervous about being around James like this alone though, even though he seems like a decent guy they're still scary and she's barely a half step into figuring herself out. 
31. Now lets be honest girl, you were the one who was doing almost all of the flirting tonight. James had barely gotten to the point where he had started to relax enough to start when you suddenly needed to leave the restaurant. 
32. Sis please you were just a bit relieved that James seemed to have calmed down a bit and so you decide to show yourself to him into a cute and somewhat snug nightie?!? You're going to either kill the man with mental shock or make him so hard he actually passes out.
33. Wait they talk up how short she is and she's a solid inch or so taller than me? That can't be right.
34. Yeah that's a very intimate way to be touched. Avoiding shivering there is a hell of a feat.
35. Also that whisper was very flirty.
36. Lol that annoyance at James's "experience" absolutely isn't in the way I think either of them were likely to have read it as.
37. Hey she managed not to "correct" one out of three times that she thought about her breast(s) and nipple(s) as being actually hers. That's some progress I think!
38. "Now I went in and out in all the appropriate places" damn right you do!
39. Touched her one way and it made her zone out, touch her another way and she's more awake than she's ever been in her life!
40. Down girl, you (unfortunately) need to finish these measurements!
41. She's probably never been this turned on in her life. Also hitting the jackpot with apparently getting a taste of "girl horny" without even needing the hormones to help.
42. Oh he really really wants her. 
43. You've gotta be kidding me, at a previous christmas party she got mixed up with the other women and kissed James?!?
44. Ah wig glue and missing boymode clothes, what a perfect combo for cute scenarios.
45. Ahhh he kissed her, sure a half unconscious drunk kiss barely counts but still!
46. No you're definitely the beautiful woman he had on his mind, there's absolutely no way that's not the case. Still doesn't make it not a scary thing for you to try to wrap your mind around so I cant exactly blame you for running from it at least for now.
47. I hope you at least cleaned your face before collapsing into bed, cleaning makeup off and otherwise maintaining good skincare is important!

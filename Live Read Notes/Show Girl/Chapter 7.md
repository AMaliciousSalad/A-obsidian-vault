1. I'm glad she's taking to this fairly comfortably, massive props to Emily for watching out for her and helping her relax.
2. Ugh yeah guys are such creeps way too frequently, thank goodness for Emily knowing all the tricks and bringing Alex up to speed.
3. Yep they'll consistently find ways to make you out as the one acting up if you even call them out on their behavior. It's such a pain.
4. Unfortunate about the taser idea being illegal, guess you'd need to get associated with a certain hall/basement to get your hands on one or more. That probably counts as a loophole.
5. Oh and she's back to the self denial, this time via being violently blind to how blatantly James is infatuated with her.
6. Hey they might not have gossiped about you. 
7. All very good advice: never give up control over what people do when interacting with you and prioritize yourself above potentially having a scene start up and alienating anyone 
8. Now Alex we both know you haven't forgotten a single word James said yesterday, you know very well that he values you above the product and Emily knows it too.
9. Thank you for accepting what she said! You really need to value yourself more!
10. Having other girls around helping support you is one of the best things.
11. When you're being really dysphoric and/or drowning in imposter syndrome having other women around can definitely be a bit of a double edged sword though. You can easily be hyperaware of whatever you don't have/feel you don't have, but they're also the best for affirming you.
12. Dammit, I still hate seeing a girl mentally harming herself like Alex is right now.
13. Well you won't always need to have an Emily to carry around with you all the time if you stop telling yourself that you're fake and the like. That's easier said than done though and I'm very aware of that.
14. Emily is right, you look fantastic and chose a remarkably "normal" outfit for the models, you might be jealous of some of the aspects of the other girls' outfits but Emily is absolutely correct that many/most of the others will be jealous of how reasonable the dress is.
15. I think Emily would be a hell of a wonderful manager for models. She's fantastic at calming nerves, helping understand what to watch out for, and making the model value and prioritize herself.
16. It's fun causing guys to be really nervous around you, though it can get a bit exhausting eventually.
17. Yeah no the crisis definitely isn't years in the past, it's just on the back burner while you get to live in your element for a bit.
18. I'm pulling a blank on if "Rayleigh's Journal" is supposed to be a direct reference to an actual technical journal or just a stand in for the concept.
19. "You need a particular type of screen, but it definitely works." If you need a particular type of screen then it's not just a software fix to a hardware problem! It's a software + hardware solution to the problem! It's just that it might be that a new hardware didn't need to be invented.
20. Having the camera in the middle of the screen is an interesting idea, makes it much easier to look at the camera while also getting a clear view of how you look.
21. Yep you sure have been giving out your real name to a lot of people while in girl mode. Just more reason to not stop after the event!
22. Lol Harry is into his(? depending on how much of a mirror this character is, the nervousness around her is definitely readable as trans behavior and not just shy boy around pretty women behavior) supervisor too.
23. Yes Alex, give into the forcefem urges, use them on yourself and then other "boys."
24. Yep getting to do stuff like that is super fun!
25. Oof that mermaid setup sounds like a massive pain. The other outfits that Emily called out to Alex are also pretty wild (though as she said not quite as egregious.) 
26. "Sadists; straight men; what's the difference?" You're so right about everything Emily, and you deliver excellent lines on top of it all.
27. Awww the little hand kiss between Marcus and Kit is/was adorable indeed!
28. Yay she's having fun with the other girls during the lull thanks to this big presentation!
29. It felt like you belonged because you do belong Alex! The only even slightly strange thing is how much you're insisting on denying that you belong!
30. Oh James showed up in the literal outfit of Alex's dreams, that'll be a bit of a shock to her system that's for sure.
31. Can't blame her for wanting to escape for a bit. Good on Emily for spotting it and encouraging her to get the space she needed.
32. I'm sorry Alex but while Ben seeing things that you don't believe are there will make you unable to handle those things: you're already not handling them at all, you're just hiding from them and hoping they go away.
33. And here comes another wave of dysphoria and mental self-harm… oh kicking something is starting to get borderline physical self harm too. Pushing the self hatred out is good, but you need to keep doing it not going right back to it the moment you accidentally admit to yourself that you don't just *want* James, you're hopelessly in love with him too.
34. Emily is a saint. You're fucking right you're going to make sure you hire her after this, it'll be really good to have her around I think (assuming she doesn't blow up if/when she learns more about Alex, if that happens I'll be very very upset)
35. You're right James, she did do a fantastic job with Harry. 
36. Dammit girl, stop doing this to yourself. He really does love you back and it's very bad for your mental health to assume you're not good or the best for him.
37. I can't even be happy for the really good indication of a successful future for their product, Alex is hurting too much and trying to bottle it all up so intently that it's the only thing I can think about.
38. Yeah dealing with men like that for hours on end will wear you the hell out. Compounded with you trying to deal with jealousy and gender stuff at the same time and you'll be so completely emotionally and mentally exhausted it'll be hard to function at all.
39. Thank you for saving her from that situation James, though it'll come with the unintended effect of complicating her feelings even more right now.
40. Of course he's really angry right now, he meant that promise yesterday and is probably still furious with himself for already accidentally hurting you once today, all of that's absolutely going to be channeled into wanting to protect you even more.
41. Ahhh, I'm hurting. She's still refusing to actually think she can have/deserve anything she wants. What you want isn't impossible! You can just reach out and grab the womanhood that you so desperately want. Bottom dysphoria and the common related brain worms are both awful, I'm so sorry
42. No no no no no no no, trying to be *that* again is an awful idea. The attempt might hurt so much that you get the right shock to your system to realize that it's not just "another person" that you want to be — it's that you want to just be/already are a woman — but it could just as easily send you spiraling in a really really direction.
43. Yeah this is looking like a slide towards option two. 
44. It's good that she has people around that care about her and contacted her. 
45. Yeah no Alex, the bouncer's double take is because a girl just handed him an id that claims she's a man, not anything about you looking young.
46. Oh some lady has decided to approach and talk to Alex, I wonder what she wants to say.
47. Mostly just icebreaker small talk so far, and boredom as a provided reasoning for coming over to talk.
48. I'm honestly not sure if Vicky was reading Alex as a guy or a girl, but Alex was definitely uncomfortable with the idea of acting like a guy at the very least.
49. Hopefully exchanging emails doesn't lead to any problems down the line.
50. Sure, interacting with people as a woman for one day wouldn't make a guy uncomfortable with acting like a guy again, but you're not one so that doesn't apply to you.
51. 5 stars for the Uber driver for not trying to start conversation, first one where it wasn't in part thanks to overtly treating you like a woman.
52. So the main result of trying to be a guy again for a bit was triggering a near fugue state while walking around thanks to acute dysphoria and finding you're really uncomfortable trying to be/act like a guy before dismissing that obviously correct conclusion.
53. Yeah you feel safer with your boobs on, and not just because you're worried about people noticing that something is a bit off if they see her without them.
54. And of course you feel even more comfortable changing into more overtly fem clothes
55. Dammit James, she almost walked right into a big realization until you interrupted her thoughts. She still seems to have realized part of where her thoughts were headed but it's probably not to the extent that she might've otherwise gotten to.
56. Yeah you are getting close to at least part of the truth, now stop refusing to even think the truth much less say it!
57. "Please don't picture it please don't imagine it please don't think of me as him, not yet, not ever, I'm begging you…" I really want to give her a hug right now.
58. Oh indeed.
59. Okay yeah, any chance of him seeing her as a guy is pretty dashed right now if he's running into the "I honestly can't tell if you're wearing makeup so I just assumed one of the two options" thing that guys seem to trip over when dealing with women.
60. You sure did let that not-insignificant fact that you put on the lip gloss on after you knew it was him slip. 
61. James the rest of your sentence there is supposed to be "but I'm only interested in you" or the like, not "but I'm not here to meet women. Except in a professional capacity."
62. Did Ben tell you not to tell her that you're interested in her until she acknowledges herself as a woman properly or are you just scared of how she'll respond too? That "No." while gazing into Alex's eyes isn't even remotely subtle either way.
63. Yes put some food in the girl, she needs it.
64. Sandwiches are good, you should never underestimate how much a good sandwich can hit the spot.
65. Maybe James did get some coaching or did some reading, he's doing better with talking to her about anything and especially this than before that's for sure. Gently pushed her to talk about how it felt trying to go out as a guy again while calling out that it was clearly really weird for her. 
66. "I know you and I trust you, even though I probably shouldn't." I can see the shit eating grin on James' face so easily right now.
67. James is being impressively insightful right now. It's very possible even really likely that Vicky could be a lesbian, and yeah the bouncer makes more sense if you assume he just saw you as a woman until checking your id and was confused or trying to be a transphobic ass with the "sir."
68. Lol that teasing grin probably did leave James deserving that thrown sandwich.
69. Okay if James is using the term "male fail" now he absolutely either got coached, researched a ton, or both.
70. "Don't worry about it, if you really miss it that much, we'll rediscover your manhood together when all this is over." He's using a pretty soft hand here, and Alex seems a bit less resistant to the implications when it's coming from him. Same with asking about the whole "the old me" thing in the way he did. Yeah just saying "maybe you shouldn't go back then" might not get received well quite yet, not going to be annoyed with him for cutting himself off that time.
71. Smooth subject shift, and sharing cheesecake is a wonderful new subject.
72. How the hell can you possibly think that he could either overlook how you feel about him or fail to see how he feels about you after sharing the cheesecake like *that*!?!
73. Oh good for Ben! 
74. Wow, inviting him to stay the night are we Alex? Good job making sure he knows not to do anything, though right now I think the one most likely to touch the other person in the night is you. 
75. Fairly clever timing to ask her those questions, she's too tired to have the fear/self rejection response be as active as it's been most of the time. Though if she was actually so tired that she didn't process said questions at all then the agreeable "Mmm…"s might cause a bit of confusion come the morning. That smile he was giving her as she fell asleep unfortunately doesn't do much to clarify what he thought her responses meant.

* Few pages in and I get jumpscared with my name lol, guess I've gotta get attached to this character now if they look like someone with my name and are also pretty
* Oh fuck, Max was raised catholic, loved singing hymns at mass growing up (only good thing about going even if the messaging is sometimes really creepy for some of them), and that helped give a bit of a base for doing voices and voice training. The story is desperate to give me tons of reasons to relate to this character huh

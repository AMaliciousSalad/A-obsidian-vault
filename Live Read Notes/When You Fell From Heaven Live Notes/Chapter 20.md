1. I'm feeling envious of even this half lie relationship Maxine has with her mom right now. Same with the more fully open relationship Taylor has with her mom (though yeah she has plenty of secrets she's keeping from her mom too)
2. AWWWWWWWWW Taylor is fantasizing about getting married to Maxine!  
3. Lol of course she noticed the present that Maxine was certain that she wouldn't notice. 
4. "This time there are zero tanks that could be mistaken for sports bras, or sports bras that could be mistaken for sports bras" Good job being careful, though I don't know how much longer that cute face of yours will be passing as "guy" to this girl who's also your best friend (or one of them at least.)
5. Holy shit my heartrate when Avery was checking the pictures from the game.
6. Yeah Max I'm worried about Avery too. I'm also still wondering if she did notice that pronoun slip up Taylor dropped a while back.
7. She turns 18 and it's like her will to meaningfully suppress just how hot she is for Maxine has all but disappeared. 
8. Lol Garrett yes this is "something else you're not supposed to worry about."
9. Yeah not replying that you'd prefer to suck on Taylor is probably a good idea there Maxine
10. Can't really blame Garrett for wanting to get really high, sure is a lot he has to process.
11. Oh my goodness, Willa and Eddie's gift for Taylor is wonderful. 
12. Lol Taylor just keeps on realizing she's been crushing on more and more girls huh
13. Max got her an NES with ROB!!! I'm jealous of that too. Hey Vampire Queens is here too, now there's an Alysonverse tie-in
14. Lol there's the little tumbling sequence from the movie, but Kennedy is the one who did it instead huh
15. Okay so Kennedy has figured it out, especially after a few minutes of watching Max and Taylor tonight. Also "just be like me, Maxine. Be exactly what you're expected to be (well Max definitely isn't doing that considering the whole stealth transition thing), graduate, get the hell out, and never come back." is basically screaming there's more going on with Kennedy than "just" having an overbearing mother who's trying to live through her.
16. That's pretty much the perfect way to handle hearing a friend say "Kinda never thought I'd make it that far" with *that* implication, at least after you can tell she's no longer thinking that's what's going to happen to her
17. Tay you're being extremely optimistic if you think Kennedy previously only saw you as "the talented and hardworking cheerleader who rose to be better than Kennedy herself, to become captain"
18. Lol with some of these looks Kennedy is giving Taylor I'm betting that her and Max are an open secret with the parts of the squad that aren't *that* close with either of them, possibly the same with Willa and Eddie if that's the case
19. "You're the cool punk cheerleader, Maxine. To my sister, that's like the most amazing thing a girl could ever be." Not just to your sister Justin, that's one of the coolest things a girl can be in general.
20. Lmao with how these cheer girls are reacting to Maxine just *prepping* to play the guitar I'm wondering if any of them are actually just attracted to guys.
21. Okay so there's where it was mentioned that Kennedy and clique were there but just picked a room and never left it till they basically had to
22. "Remember the kid who died, it was this guy called Maxwell, you wouldn't know him; he went to another school." Damn Maxine, really putting your old costume out to pasture even more in your mind huh
23. Not much in mind about the whole Gordo showing up thing, went about as well as could be hoped for. And yes I was absolutely right that Kennedy had at least figured out Eddie, Willa, and Danny. That little laugh into her hand pretty much cinches it.
24. "Yes Mom I am wearing panties to church!" Lol even freaking out on a time crunch Maxine is still delightfully sassy.
25. Oh no, poor thing saw *him* in the mirror, I can feel exactly what she's feeling in this moment and it's awful. Thanks again Clay for helping her push through it.
26. Huh I guess Kennedy is straight then, now I'm wondering what it is other than just her mom that is making her want to GTFO forever.
27. See Max that's how a normal guy reacts to being offered hormones: "No. No, Maxine. No." Their sibling banter is as always absolutely top notch!
28. Oh spotting Dominique here is really really not good, there goes the "well it's not the panic attack I was expecting" thing. At least she seems to have survived Dominique scanning her eyes past her. This priest needs to die painfully, just like pretty much every single other priest I've ever known. And Maxine's mom nodding along is making my stomach tie up in awful knots. FUCK FUCK FUCK now I'm having to shut down a panic attack.
29. I wish I had had Clay's strength to just fucking walk out in disgust so many times. Instead I kinda just faded away from catholic shit as soon as I was able to.

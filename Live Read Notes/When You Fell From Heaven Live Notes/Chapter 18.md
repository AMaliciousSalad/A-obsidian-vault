1. "You might be. Mostly, I think you're drunk." You have such a way with words Maxine.
2. Oh no, Max has two incredibly drunk girls feeling incredibly guilty regarding her doesn't she, an exhausting thing to try to handle right after everything with Avery. Especially now that Jim just reminded her about what's going on with Avery
3. Okay yes "Maxwell" is basically a figment at this point, that doesn't mean that what Avery liked about you was that figment. What she liked you for was you, not *"him"*. Good that you're working yourself towards that conclusion now though.
4. "I'll just wait for Avery's life to stabilize and then I'll tell her everything." No don't lock yourself into thinking like that, that's how you end up the way I did: not talking to people you cared about and were pretty much 100% certain would accept you just because things never seemed stable enough to justify it.
5. "Oh my gosh, just freaking kiss me already." Thank you Taylor! "I didn't want to go to sleep without that." with "I think that might have been the most important moment of my entire life." as a response!?!??!!! Ahhh this is way too cute for me, and now I'm yearning again.
6. "The first thing she sees is a weird sorta black blob... It's Maxine. It's Maxine! (or at least the most kissable part of Maxine)" Wow even extremely hung over Taylor only has Max on the mind, that's one hell of a devoted girl.
7. Yeah I want to give Garrett a quick kick in the balls
8. Dammit, she's having a dysphoria spiral again. Girl needs a hug, and maybe another trans girl or two to commiserate with
9. She does seem to work her way through them to an extent rather quickly, but it's still the same shit that keeps coming back so it's more like a bandage right now. And honestly yeah just giving the hormones more time is probably the best fix for that ultimately.
10. Oi no don't go waiting for Taylor to call you girlfriends. Just go and talk to her about it you dense girl.
11. I love how excited Avery is for Max getting with Taylor!
12. I don't love that she's found the need to basically withdraw from most of her schooling to survive the year
13. Made it down the stairs and immediately gets several kisses from the girl she loves, Max is living the life for at least this moment
14. Maxine is soooooo good, she handled that absolutely perfectly. Also with everything Taylor was thinking and the like I'm even more on board with at least these 3 being together.
15. Willa practically screaming she has a crush on Maxine too now, albeit maybe unintentionally
16. Also didn't write it down earlier but Taylor is 100000% right that the way that Max and Avery text each other is nothing like what a girl and a straight guy (even ones who are legitimately completely platonic and extremely close) text to each other.
17. I love how open these three are being with each other right now, and I love Willa forcing Maxine to say "I'm a girl who likes girls, and I guess I'm queer"
18. And now Taylor's showing signs of actual *interest* in Avery too, sorry Diana.....
19. Good to know that Tay's mom isn't overtly against lesbians, even if she hesitated for a moment before jumping on the "what's happening to Avery is awful" side of things. 
20. FUCK YES! Max got the nerve up to just fucking ask "are we dating, are you my girlfriend?" And "Am I *your* girlfriend?" with Taylor responding perfectly both times!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I think I'm gonna cry too Maxine.

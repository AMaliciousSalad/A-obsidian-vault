1. Yeah no it makes perfect sense for you to just be exhausted and need to process things instead of getting all giddy/girly/and energetic about everything that just happened.
2. She's really starting to see her future and accepting it as the only one for her. The only one that's real at least
3. AHH this little text and wave conversation is absurdly cute, and the little blown kiss!!!
4. Oh cool we got confirmation of exactly which hormones she's taking
5. Lol she's already making "how could the hormones have not drastically transformed me in no time flat" jokes!
6. Poor Avery, this is yet another reason for minorities not to get cops involved: when they inevitably don't do shit to help it does just encourage your tormentors. "Everyone should be lesbians, it would be so much better."
7. Can't say I was expecting the Karl Marx joke, and Max definitely went denial mode a bit too quick that wasn't safely denying it like she thinks, Avery is absolutely going to be a bit suspicious
8. And there she goes, messaging Taylor immediately after saying bye to Max
9. Taylor is going to try to put on a heroic attempt at damage control to avoid outing Max before Max is ready to explain herself to Avery. Not sure how successful she can hope to be though
10. Goddess she's really trying, but how could you possibly convince Avery that a "guy" who looks like that and is a cheerleader could possibly be protected by just Taylor, her friends, and a couple other people?
11. She almost made it all the way through without she/hering Max, but she slipped up right at the very end when trying to really impress the fact that there are people looking after Max, Avery doesn't seem to have caught it off the bat though
12. Oh yeah, it's fucking scary thinking about telling those closest to you about you. I also desperately hope that Avery would never reject her like she and Taylor have considered in their worst fears.
13. Aww Clay is getting into aggressively protective big brother mode, but in a slightly different way than before. Still not perfect or anything but different
14. The pronoun transition after looking herself in the mirror was so smooth I didn't catch it for a couple lines! She's starting to really embody herself!
15. Hmm Max has got some brainworms about looking at beautiful women she loves to work through it seems, it's not "male" to find the girl you're in love with's breasts attractive
16. See Taylor can't stop herself from checking out every inch of you!
17. WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN YOU ALREADY KNEW ABOUT TRANSGENDER PEOPLE!?!
18. Fucking hell Tay, for a pretty smart girl you're being a bit of a moron about Max
19. That little reminiscing on Max and Clay's past as kids contrasted to what Maxine and Clay are like right now is adorable
20. Hopefully that little "boy" would be impressed by how high she can fly indeed
21. She showed Avery the transition/progress photos, absentmindedly/casually confirmed that she would like being like those girls, and Taylor is finally realizing that her "impossible dream" of Maxine being forever might almost certainly actually be real and she's making sure she can help and be there for her every step of the way!
22. Hmm a bit of pronoun backsliding, not surprising though given the circumstances she's in. The hug while shes hiding everything under that massive shirt would be nerve destroying
23. Getting stuck in the guy voice for a bit is also fairly concerning, girl's nerves are probably completely overloaded right now
24. Yeah the extra safety of the separate space doesn't really offset the feeling of othering and the isolation
25. Needing to have one of her parents sign off on her being part of the cheer squad is a real pickle, hopefully she and her friends find a way to make it work or get around it
26. Cliffhanger right before the first cheer practice begins, I can't decide if I should keep going or try to get to sleep at a more reasonable time tonight

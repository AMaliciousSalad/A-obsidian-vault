* Opening with a flashback huh, good to see Alyson is still herself, I was a bit worried after the almost complete non-cliffhanger at the end of book 1/chapter 10
* Yeah Max, getting traumatized/having PTSD will do that to you. It's really hard to function normally sometimes and almost random seeming stuff becomes a problem even when it's connected to something you genuinely love. Like even before I realized that I had been fucked up by the way my parents handled "grounding" (sit or lay on your bed, no books other than maybe a bible, no other entertainment, no speaking without being spoken to, no leaving the room unless it's to use the restroom or do something my parents ordered, continue for days to around a month or so on end) I had been avoiding beds whenever possible, like I slept in a hammock for a couple years and now I still sleep on a floor futon despite having a functional bed available that my roommates left when they moved out. Had "friends" whose houses I had to steel myself before entering as a kid too, not sure I'd be able to open the door without panicking now that I understand better what they did to me.
* It's good she managed to find music as another thing to interest her at least a bit, music is so good (it basically single handedly kept me going for a few of the early puberty years)
* She's both fictional and in the past in this fiction and I still wish I could hug this poor hurt girl
* Okay Avery but in person this time rather than over text chat, I wonder what she's going to be like with Max here.
* "Hey, bitch!" yes this girl really is great huh, I can tell I'm going to like her in these flashback sections. 
* Ooh yeah having to go back to school is going to be really rough. I'm glad Avery isn't holding it against Max at all, she's just angry on her behalf and worried about her.
* That's some pretty serious disassociation hitting as she enters the school, how dare you cliffhanger the flashback like that Alyson
* I wonder how much time has passed between end of chapter 10 and the start of this "now" section, it's really cute seeing how much effort Max is putting into painting Tay's toes, and Tay really just can't stop forgetting that Max still needs to be able to be a *guy* at home
* Yes the fumes you have to deal with when doing polish are a big part of why I rarely use any, gives me headaches.
* Well Taylor, Max doesn't have to be a guy for her to fix your being single problem, of course that sets off other issues with people at school and potentially compromises your shots at a cheer scholarship so it's a bit complicated if your goal is to try to keep the guys away
* Taylor is so worried about having a guy steal Max from her, lol yeah gender really is complicated. It's so tricky trying to juggle not pushing Max into unanswerable questions while also trying to understand everything about her isn't it Tay?
* Don't like Max continuing to misgender herself in her own head (yes she hasn't actualized yet but it still stings a bit and can't be making her feel any better either)
* At least she's making herself acknowledge that she wants to spend as little time having to present as "Maxwell" as possible, even if that means she's pushing her luck a bit from time to time
* Jim you're super sweet but come on man, you've gotta put a damper on calling Max "love" much less a girl when in her house. I guess it's maybe sort of good that it's a bit of a wake up call for her that she's being a little reckless with the getting caught risk.
* Oh yeah, forgetting about the voice is a real thing, gotta be careful with that Max. Like I'm not technically out at work in general or to some of my immediate team as well (I work from home so it's maybe 5% less ridiculous than that sounds to anybody who looked at the recent photo I shared), and was really careful to try to keep up the guy voice during meetings and stuff but yeah at some point I realized I'd been slipping and so that's pretty much been dropped, same thing with relatives, so that's a decent number of people that I just have no idea what's in their heads regarding me.
* Well yeah Jim, of course switching back into the guy voice wouldn't make the girl happy, sometimes you seem to understand a good bit and then the next moment you seem confused by the most basic things
* Oh nice Jim got the good pill sets, the sugar pills are absolutely useless especially for Max's purposes
* Yeah it would probably be pretty hard to find photo or video of trans women with implant less breasts in the early 00s, especially when you don't really know what to search for
* Fingers crossed that Jim doesn't go full chaser, but his interest in her/what she's doing doesn't seem to be swinging that way so far at the very least, and his consistent and careful insistence on maintaining her dignity is another good sign
* Girl just can't properly avoid oversharing can she, also lol is she into cat/petplay now too with that bit of imagining she was doing there
* Not surprising that thinking/talking about all that would set off a bit of a dysphoric episode, it's not good when you're convincing yourself that people are only seeing you as you out of kindness or the like
* *Fuck.* Yeah, I get all of that completely Maxine, I think most if not all of us do, and it hurts and sometimes yeah it's embarrassing but you're fucking right that it's completely worth it.
* Lmao she keeps forgetting to do the guy voice, this is going to be a recurring problem isn't it. Also great job teasing Clay and Jim there Max
* Come on Clay, don't give her grief about her hair and if/how she plays with it or any other "effeminate gestures," why must you contribute to making it impossible for her to feel comfortable at home
* Taylor really does hurt for Max when she has to try to be a guy, and she's so completely infatuated with her as a girl but somehow doesn't seem to properly realize that
* Girl doesn't really believe that she'll grow boobs but already has noticed her nipples getting itchy, smh
* Actually Max you can probably really tell her that, she already sees you as a girl, at worst telling her that this whole thing has actually given you life will probably make her feel better about seeing you that way and have her even more desperate to take away your pain
* I love how Max acts towards Garrett "What do *you* think?" as a response to being asked if her fake ID should have an F on it is so good. 
* It can be so good when something you're dysphoric about starts to change for the better, I'm happy for you Max
* Yeah girl, and the attraction to Max isn't going to fade because **you're not straight**! 
* I hear/see the lines are killer, I haven't had to or gotten to deal with that yet though as I've only used the women's room once (to be fair it's also the only time I've used a public restroom since moving, and pre-move I was trying to do the boymode thing but not as a meme)
* Yes, good. Recognize that there's no good reason to beat yourself up about not ever being able to perform masculinity the way you might have been expected to. Oh what's the other reason your masculinity matters to you? It's probably Taylor isn't it, and you think she's straight so therefore you can't completely abandon it because of how smitten you are
* Yep I'm right. Kinda funny and quite sad that both of these girls are so worried that a guy is going to take the other one away from her. especially funny when Taylor has absolutely no reason to think Max like guys outside of the comphet expectation that's also making her so uncertain/confused about how she feels about Max right now
* Oh is Tay starting to actually figure some things out? Oh she was into Robyn too huh, just never realized it till now. Also I was fucking right again in my reads about her "attraction" to Gordo. take that doubts!
* Oh **fuck**.

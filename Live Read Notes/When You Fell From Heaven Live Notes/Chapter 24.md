1. Yeah it does feel like it should be pouring rain right now.
2. Fuck, even if/when the thing with Avery resolves a bit this is going to cascade into her parents learning it isn't it.
3. The poor girl has collapsed now...............
4. Goddess I love Taylor so fucking much right now
5. That 2 seconds of levity is kinda everything right now. Also Alyson whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?
6. No Coach Heisler you had it right the first time.
7. Yeah the idea of a girl (or a guy) liking you *as a boy/guy/man* is an awful feeling, it's one of the many reasons I could never stomach the idea of actually telling anyone that I like liked how I actually felt.
8. Poor kid, already getting pelted with transmisogyny and doesn't even begin to understand what it is or why she's being targeted with it
9. So that's at least one of the times Maxine ended up borrowing Avery's underwear that was mentioned in chapter 19 I think
10. It's awful that she's back to feeling that type of shame over being seen again.
11. I hate how strong Maxine is having to make herself be right now, it's wrong that she has to or even feels like she has to.
12. Being strong in *this* way and being fragile to the point of needing help putting yourself back together isn't a binary.
13. She's good at truly making herself stunning though isn't she. Well time for another flashback
14. I know that wasn't the real goodbye moment for them back then, but it's still heartbreaking. I think I've told this before but a couple days before my "final moving away goodbye" with my closest friends when I was doing my second to intrastate move, all three of us had to step out of the restaurant we were eating at and ugly cried together on the sidewalk by a lamp pole, except while they hugged and held each other I separated myself by stepping a couple feet back towards the light pole and collapsed against it. It was a combination of feeling like I didn't deserve to be a real part of that unit and trying to respect the fact that one of them is/was really uncomfortable with guys touching her and that's what I was to her as far as I know/knew
15. True! Football isn't as serious a sport as cheerleading!
16. Maxine continues to be great: "Everybody does. Because I kind of am a girl, Ave." Is a very good line.
17. Avery's slip up at the "she's growing real ones" is actually pretty dang funny
18. Well yeah, a lesbian choosing her guy best friend as her "learn to kiss well" partner (as more than a one-off) doesn't happen unless she's bi or the guy needs some very heavy scare quotes around the word "guy." The fact that she was into to Maxine was pretty fucking obvious pretty early on in the story
19. I feel like Willa saying "Didn't you ever get changed with him?" has a bit of a typo with that him at the end of that question
20. Fuck I'm so sorry Maxine
21. Hell of a plan there Taylor, I really hope it works out even remotely how you plan for it to.
22. Tay you're just a bit evil and I love you for it.
23. I can see how one line this chapter could really feed into Diana's hardline OTP position
24. Ugh I really hate the "you're *gone* now" thing. Thank you Taylor for doing your thing and jumping right on that immediately, with Maxine coming in with what should be a slam dunk of an argument as to why she isn't a different person.
25. Fuck I'm glad that all seems to have worked out. That goodbye kiss is still really sad though.

1. The different "natural smell" is such a big difference, I still don't really understand how I didn't have so many people (at least other women) clock me just off that. 
2. I love how giddy being with Taylor is making Max, even to the point where it's dulling her dysphoria. 
3. Trying to mostly be yourself around your parents while just hiding the more overt guy stuff sounds good for mental health, less so for not accidentally letting the girl stuff slip. 
4. Gonna be honest Max, you're not at all giving a convincing guy mode here with some of this behavior with your parents. Maybe they won't notice though
5. Oh yeah I remember my parents saying dumb shit about the cheerleaders any time they were shown on tv and I was seen to be paying exactly any attention to them. Though I don't remember the last time I saw NFL cheerleaders actually doing much of any real routine stuff at games, which is a shame (though even if they were always shown doing real routines nothing could make me *want* to watch full NFL games)
6. I adore Maxine and Clay's dynamic here. I'd be rolling on the floor laughing at that exchange if I saw it irl, as it is I'm getting a really nice laugh in my chair at least.
7. Yeah Taylor it really does suck how you two aren't able to spend even a fraction of the time you want to together, much less time getting to do girlfriend stuff.
8. I'm glad Max is having fun playing at having a boyfriend around Kennedy and her clique. 
9. "I got out of the locker room in under 5 minutes and it only took a bunch of mediocre downsides and increasing interest in Maxine's background" see that doesn't sound like a good thing per-se
10. Aww, Tay found a good excuse to visit Max in her locker room and took full advantage of it. I love that for both of them!
11. This is so exciting, Max is about to have her first game day! This mini pep rally should be a fun warmup! 
12. The contrast from being one of the kids avoiding all the school spirit stuff at her old school to being one of the cheerleaders now is pretty big huh Maxine.
13. A bunch of the squad and Justin hyping Max to yell "It's game day!" is a nice moment
14. "When they renovated this place back in the nineties, they inexplicably forgot to provide for the most important pieces in the complicated jigsaw puzzle that is high school football: the cheerleaders!" As usual you're right Taylor, unfortunately most of the world hasn't quite caught up to your wisdom yet. 
15. Yes, she did great at the mini pep rally! I'm kinda sad we didn't get to see it, but at least Tay's here to fill us in on how it went. 
16. "Her mom, though. She'd see it. Moms always do." Taylor please stop with the death/clocking flags!
17. Yes, sunscreen and moisturizing are key for happy skin!
18. Thank you Taylor and Kennedy for helping her get past the momentary panic from the sheer sensory overload!
19. Yes Max you are a gymnast and a cheerleader so you damn well can do anything! (You also have Taylor with you so right now you could even kill god)
20. Woops I'm tearing up a bit at the description of what it's like for her and Max to be out there doing this as part of the squad, it sounds better than just about any type of high I can imagine
21. Ugh Gordo staring at Maxine is making my skin crawl a bit too. Leave her alone! Thanks again Justin for providing cover!
22. Good opportunity for Max to build up the myth of her mom, even if she would've preferred not being overheard
23. Oh yeah and she really wants her mom in her life properly so of course doing so is causing her some anguish.
24. Stings seeing how it's very much Maxine and her mental hang-ups that're making her feel separate from the other girls on the squad right now. 
25. Maxine borrowed Avery's underwear a couple times???? LMAO
26. Yes, Maxine good. Recognizing that your body shape isn't actually out of the ordinary for women is a really good first step to internalizing it, though if the way some of my cis girl friends have spoken that's not any guarantee you won't still be a bit insecure about it.
27. "Mom's gotten used to Maxine smelling kinda fruity," I wonder how she'll react to you being kinda fruity girl. 
28. I'm really liking Kennedy right now.
29. Fingers crossed that Kennedy is just legitimately interested in Maxine and isn't fishing for something. The complete lack of negative reaction to her telling them that Avery is a lesbian is a good sign imo. Also the girls giving her the rundown on themselves is a fantastic way to dismiss that worry. Too bad that she can't go hang out with them a bit longer, it would be really nice for her.
30. Girl you've gotta be more careful, don't go getting that close to casually outing your big bro. These girls seem like they'd probably be chill about it but still not a good thing to do.
31. Too many good things have been happening with Max and Taylor, it feels like the calm before the storm
32. Dammit I'm crying again, I wish my family was different and I could just be my mom's daughter too.

1. Excellent start, almost got caught mid sex by Lynn. 
2. What could possibly be untoward about her only daughter and the girl next door being naked in bed together Max? Sounds like normal healthy bonding!
3. I guess it would make sense that she'd be able to feel the prosthetics as they move everything under them around with them. Clever of Taylor to give that a shot
4. It really is so wonderful when you can see how things with your have been changing, it's still fairly wonderous that it's even possible. 
5. Taylor really fucked at least some of the brainworms out of her! Dammit, that's my fantasy! 
6. Yeah realizing you're hitting that point where people who don't know are still noticing that *something* is up is pretty intimidating, really starts to feel like a fuse has been lit and you've gotta find a way to avoid or prevent the explosion.
7. Yeah the men's pants might help, but yeah you'll need a binder or the like if you really want to hide your tits anymore, and that's a step for hiding I could never get myself to take. Lol yeah the bandages probably aren't a good option, and you probably have no idea what a binding top is (though maybe Taylor does if her research has taken her into some trans guy stuff too). Not sure exactly how accessible those were in the early 2000s anyway.
8. Hopefully it doesn't all blow up for long enough that you're able to at least have a wonderful homecoming.
9. I see Taylor also very much enjoyed the sex, takes one glance at Maxine after waking up and is damn near rearing to go again before noticing her girlfriend looks a bit uncomfortable
10. I'm so sorry about all that anxiety girl, it really fucking sucks. Crazy that Tay can notice the miniscule height shrinkage after only those two months of hrt.
11. Taylor is really enjoying that permission to check Max out. Holy shit girl, went from enjoying the view, to noticing Maxine's breast buds, to thinking about apple pie, to asking if Max wants some chili. This might be the least one track "Maxine, Maxine, Maxine, Maxine" mode we've seen her mind operating in in chapters!
12. Ohhhh that's why Lynn watches her crockpot like a hawk!
13. Garrett is such a little shit. Fuck, I didn't think that would just mean Tay's dad had yelled at Garrett either, Max isn't the only one who really needs to internalize that parents hitting their children is not only wrong but also not normal.
14. It's good that Maxine is able to explain these thoughts to Taylor better now that she's not quite mid anxiety attack at the moment, and Taylor isn't wrong: people (parents almost in particular) tend to only see what they expect/want to see, people being trans/transitioning is so far outside that expectation for most people that it's almost inconceivable, and if that's still the case now when we're hyper scrutinized then it was even more the case in 2003. 
15. Good girl, came up with a good idea for helping Max with her disguise, and proved just how real those developing breasts are to help after the idea worked just a little bit too well.
16. I adore just how certain Taylor is that she'll be with Maxine forever, there's not a single doubt in her mind and that's wonderful!
17. The way she is so very repulsed by both the idea of Maxine getting hit by and getting seen as a guy by Max's mom is great too.
18. Poor Clay, getting dragged out of bed by his little sis before/at 5 in the morning so he can give her a ride. Hey Max I sure didn't get that AIM message, you might need to send it again!
19. She's really been optimizing her "keep the room safe" strats, actually pretty solid planning there girl.
20. I might've spoken too soon, she's singing at 5AM (probably in her real voice) while still in her parents' house. 
21. Max and Avery's banter is great, I can't wait till I get to see how Avery reacts to *really seeing* Maxine (hopefully sometime soon!)
22. Ugh I can feel that desire to go to that before time with your parents, in the time between when I started transitioning and was forced to come out to them I had almost thought they were improving as people again, like I was able to enjoy spending time with them a bit in situations where they weren't in full control at least. That little delusion sure did get shattered when I came out, and my mom's occasional letters she's sent since I fled their state have done a great job maintaining my disillusionment. 
23. "When I was a cheerleader we had a word for women like that: jealous bitches" I love Lynn so much, if she ever disappoints me It'll fucking shatter my heart for a couple hours.
24. Oh eww, no don't try to be the one bringing Max to school. That's a fucking pile of nightmares right there.
25. Clay is the best big brother a trans girl could possibly hope for. He feels sick when he refers to her as a guy! I know a couple cis women who've expressed a similar feeling when it comes to referring to me, one of my coworkers recently got actually angry when she had to mention me on Azure DevOps and even after taking the time to remove my deadname from the mention (leaving only my last name) the tool then just added it again when she submitted the message, but I can't really imagine a cis guy feeling like that.
26. Speaking of scars: I'm still shocked at how few visible ones I have. Considering how many poorly tended for wounds I had growing up it's a not insignificant miracle that I've only got like one fairly big scar and a handful of not that visible ones (I'm not counting my many stretch marks)
27. Lol of course Couch Dale has figured out Taylor and Maxine too
28. Even if Avery were here I'm not sure she'd ever go for being a cheerleader, might have to give up on that idea coach.
29. I love Clay so fucking much, it was a bit scary back when he first found out about Max but he's proven himself to be so good over and over again. 
30. Hey I had a Speak & Spell as a kid
31. No you're probably closer to right than you would like to be Max, Taylor is worse at hiding how in love with you she is than you are at playing Mario.
32. Can't let it be forgotten that Max has it really bad for Taylor too, she can't let her mind wander or she starts fantasizing about eating her out. Maybe not the best thing to be dwelling on while the pep rally is still going on, some of it's probably Gordo's fault. He did  prime her a bit with that last second miming.
33. Yes, arm yourself girls.
34. Max in her cute cheerleader outfit is so much better than in the guys' cheerleader outfit. You're really missing out Avery.
35. Good girl Max, actually giving Taylor a heads up about kissing Jim for show this time! Kinda cruel to turn her on to that absurd extent right before having to dip, but at least you got a bit of a taste of your own medicine in the crossfire and have something to look forward to soon.
36. Jim is still a bit of a guy sometimes, truly a shame.
37. Can't say I was expecting a "the office" reference, good to see that even if she's awful at video games she's still got good taste: the office is so absurdly overrated (both versions)
38. Being able to handle being looked at is a hard ass skill to get down, I might've been transitioning a good bit longer than Max but I'm only a few weeks up on her on the actually being myself in public thing, hasn't quite clicked yet.
39. "Oh, fuck off and kiss my brother about it," Maxine just doesn't miss!
40. Taylor having a bit of a cheerleader/cheer uniform fetish might be the single least surprising thing I've read her realize. 
41. But hey that's one useful bit of information I can at least partially chalk up to how brutally Maxine turned on and left Tay to stew
42. Yeah the bottom dysphoria sucks, good thing there are other ways for her to make you feel good (as you've at least partially learned), Taylor is going to absolutely love making you make so many wonderful noises when she gets the chance
43. You're so right Tay, Maxine does like people, getting to like people, and absolutely adores  both being kind and receiving kindness. There are so many trans girls (myself included) who I've started to describe as introverted, shy, and/or antisocial through trauma, that're like this when just given the opportunity too 
44. Avery's being cagey and her coach is hinting somethings going on but not being open about it huh, do I smell my prediction coming true on the near horizon?
45. "It's the kind of intimacy they've talked about, the kind that's safe, the kind they've seen among confirmed straight-girl friend pairings: Kennedy and Dominique, the Esses, Sandy and Jewel." Foreshadowing is a literary device...
46. Well this sounds like a build up for a hell of a panic attack for Maxine after the game if/when Avery ambushes her there
47. They wouldn't look even remotely as good in a cheer skirt, even approaching 25% would be generous much less 50%
48. It's kinda funny, kissing Jim has helped Maxine be certain she's not attracted to guys at all. I've got a similar story: I've only ever kissed and/or made out with one person: a guy and while that was quite fun it also really solidified that while I'm somewhat attracted to guys I'm definitely very much more attracted to women (I do still sometimes feel a bit bad that I spent a not trivial amount of time that we were dancing, kissing, etc. imagining doing it with one of the girls who I had belatedly realized were trying to show interest in doing the same before the guy actually asked me first)
49. Yeah Maxine, proper college+ size football stadiums are absurdly large it's frankly ridiculous 
50. Oi stop with the dooming about what might happen if/when more of the squad learns everything about Maxine
51. I can almost feel the adrenaline and euphoria of the experience of getting to cheer in that environment with how Max explained it.
52. Oh sweet the team did manage to pull off the comeback! Good for them!
53. And there's Avery, not looking happy at all!
54. Fucking hell poor Max is having the panic attack I predicted.
55. Fuck, this hurts and Avery hasn't even said a thing yet.
56. "Taylor!", well there's a start at least. Fuck I don't like that "what did you call him?" at all. I'm really really hoping that this turns out like it did with Clay. If it goes bad it could damn near permanently shatter Maxine.
57. Yeah Taylor I've been struggling with what to do with the shortened version of Maxine too.
58. Fuck these pages are going to be really hard to get through.
59. I can very much understand Avery being angry, but still FUCK.
60. Like this is exactly why I was too fucking terrified to tell any of my old close friends, like ffs all of those really close friends were queer too (hell one was even enby though that was something that came out later). If something like this happened with them it probably would've just finished me before we had a chance to resolve it.
61. It's all wrong right now
62. What a painful end to the chapter. Guess I'm staying up a while longer because I need to keep going.

1. Yeah the growing pains are a bit of a pain in the ass, close to literally if you get them around your hips.
2. Increasing pep, self-belief, and can turn you into a girl? That sounds like a lottery prize, not something that requires a warning!
3. No Max, you are not even technically a boy in a skirt. Stop it. Bad.
4. She's really self conscious about wearing a skirt today huh, I have trouble believing that Tay would've given her a skirt that's really making it so that Max's ass is "on show" for her first day
5. With one simple trick you too can have an indoor locker! Just become a girl instead!
6. Yeah should've known just having Taylor with her wouldn't be enough to shut up the imposter syndrome, dysphoria, and general anxiety. At least not on the first day of school when her life is quite literally on the line.
7. Seems like she might have calmed down a bit after making it through homeroom, and knowing Taylor would tear down the sky for Max if Tay thought it could help her is really good comfort. You can make it through this Max, and before you know it you'll get used to it!
8. Oh nice they share a lunch period, that's good! 
9. Tay is so laser focused on Max and what people are clearly seeing when they look at her that she forgot that people look at her too, now that's an impressive degree of one track mind.
10. Fun lunchroom banter about music, Max, Justin's access to funds, how school lunch apparently isn't meaningfully different on other sides of the country, cali highschool movie cliches, and Max again but turning a bit too pastwards.
11. I wonder why Max is so insistent that Justin can't possibly like her, like part of it is almost certainly all the imposter syndroming, self loathing, dysphoria, etc. but I wonder if there's actually more to it. 
12. Tay is very much on top of "gotta help this girl learn to love herself" recognition, though it's also getting twisted up a bit with how utterly in love with Max she is herself. 
13. Oh for fuck's sake girl, you just can't help yourself can you? Lmao. Just fucking tell her how you feel already, maybe then you can get all the intimate time you want with her to the point where you don't keep kissing her in dangerous spots, also you would be able to dismiss that "hope and fear" look she gets every time and replace it with just joy at getting to kiss or be kissed by the girl she loves too!
14. Ugh of course one of these dipshits would show up to harass her when she's waiting for her brother to pick her up after school. At least their teacher got them to fuck off. Here's hoping these guys trying to apologize on their behalf don't do anything stupid now either. Well opening with asking if she's a lesbian isn't a great start, especially not in this situation. And hey Clay with perfect timing to rescue her from this conversation!
15. Unfortunately Clay, being a girl's brother, being gay, or both are not in fact guarantees that a guy won't act like a perv towards said girl. 
16. Clay is right that her ability to "be Maxwell just fine" is at best an insanely tenuous claim, and doubly right that she can't switch into that act on a moments notice the way she can switch out of it. It's good she acknowledges it too. 
17. And yeah she's getting increasingly good at teasing her big bro
18. Tay's right, there's something on Willa's mind and it's not just not wanting to deal with her sister. It doesn't seem to be about Taylor, Max, or both either. Or at least not clearly about them
19. Oh she's taking progress photos now, don't get too caught up in that Max or you might start catastrophizing any time you hit a bit of a slow period, but it's also really nice for being able to prove to yourself that you really are changing. 
20. And she's getting to revel in the solid final (hopefully) realization that she just is herself now for good, and that getting to go to school as herself is just so much better, and just getting to be herself is amazing and exciting in so many ways with so much to look forward to!
21. Hmm apparently what's on Willa's mind is about those two after all, or it was one of the things at least.
22. OMG Max you are such a stereotypical teenage girl in love that it's kinda insane. You are way too fucking cute
23. Yeah no, grandkids probably aren't on the table for your mom Clay, at least not blood related ones. 
24. Yes her Maxwell does suck doesn't it Clay, not surprising as this whole thing with finally letting herself accept how Taylor obviously feels about her has completely hamstrung any chance of getting herself in the right headspace for the "Maxwell" role, even with the guy clothes, not tucking, etc. added to try to tilt the scales
25. Okay Taylor you can do this, you've recognized you were making up reasons to believe that Maxine might not like you like that, now just fucking talk to her about how you both feel about each other! 
26. Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes, do it already! YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS! She finally fucking told Maxine that she likes her that way, and Max said she likes her too!
27. Of course they're managing to follow it up by talking past each other, and Taylor is worried about what Willa might have told Max. Can't have it all be perfect can we?!?
28. Goddess thank you, Taylor isn't freaking out about it as bad as she might have seemed to initially, She knows they can just talk about it now, and that they should!
29. It's really funny that Max is arguably more worried about how Avery will take Max really loving cheerleading than about Max being Maxine. 
30. Knowing for a fact that Taylor Scott likes her has seemingly shot Max's self esteem into orbit, hopefully it's a stable one because she deserves to have all the self esteem in the world.
31. Love the self love Max, but revealing yourself for the first time to your mom in full cheerleader uniform is probably not in your top 5 best ideas. 
32. And she handled that extremely unexpected run-in with Ms Arroyo so well!
33. Tay has a frankly incredible amount of confidence in how Max will be able to handle the next few big things, and I damn well hope she's completely right
34. Oh yeah I really get the "it's getting harder and harder to care about performing *him* for others' benefit" thing, there are times when I'm tempted to just drop the paper thin charade I'm still maintaining in some situations in absurdly over the top manners, and those situations should hopefully be irrelevant soon and I really will be able to just drop it.
35. The things that should be done to Shane and those like him are probably tos so I won't describe them
36. Good don't dwell on *that* possibility Max, it's horribly unfair but you need to act and you can act now.
37. Max feeling hot, enjoying not having to change in the staff locker thanks to not changing, beautiful day out, and working to prove she can take more control over her life? You go girl!
38. And she got to fly again! I want to get to fly too!
39. This little banter between Max and Justin is fun, and lmao poor Justin his little sis is obsessed with the cool older girl who play guitar and likes the same music as her.
40. Oh it was Jim that Max texted it seems, this should be interesting.
41. This is an interesting strategy for handling the lesbian allegations Max, can't believe you didn't even give Tay a hint as to what you were up to though. 
42. I know I said that I hope Jim drops it completely after the last time he asked her, but the post-kiss flirting/teasing here doesn't bother me at all, pretty much the only appropriate situation for it he could run into. Particularly the "well if that's truly settled for good, any chance you could set me up with your brother" pivot!
43. I continue to call things just before they happen, here's Avery!
44. I was right again, she should've given Taylor a bit of a heads up. Like the fact she got so zoned out while driving is already bad enough, but depending on how she reacted when Max kissed Jim the avoiding getting outed plan could've backfired. And Taylor is having to work through some comphet brainworms here too.
45. Oh fuck no, everything happening in Avery's life right now is awful. The people she cares about are getting hurt and she's just getting more and more isolated. Max can't do anything but be long distance support, and goddess do I know the feeling of wanting to tell someone you care about everything but things are going too poorly for them or really well and you really don't want to make things about you.
46. Lmao good job Jim, you got a hold of Clay's number after all!
47. Ew Garrett, you've lost all the points you earned during the standoff with Clay
48. Yeah trying to keep up the act really fucking sucks, especially when you're trying to keep it up around someone you actually really care for. When the act is effectively trying to simulate a barely alive pile of misery it becomes even harder when you're actually alive for the first time maybe ever.
49. Good going Jim! At some point someone had to tell one or both of these useless lesbians that they can still date in secret!
50. Oi don't do the stupid thing where Willa and Taylor end up kissing right as Max walks in and it causes a ton of drama!
51. Okay so the kiss happened but Max didn't simultaneously walk in, so only half way to the cliche.
52. Well she did walk in on them being a mess in the aftermath

* Wow Taylor got really attached to Maxine in just one night
* Lol she's so completely and totally crazy for this girl, and she doesn't even fully realize she's a girl yet
* Okay so I'm becoming increasingly certain that Gordo's purpose to Taylor is to be combination repression and social armor
* Max's mom is being weird about her using nice smelling shampoo
* Girl gets to be a girl for one night and being called a "good boy" already feels like more of a joke than anything, that's fast
* Oh she really really wants to be a cheerleader huh

* Lol "you're a dude again" "don't worry about it"
* And the double with banger thinking she's hot and a casual "thanks but no thanks"
* "Cheer is the mind killer, don't do it, I take back every nice thing I said about Taylor, she's evil!" Goddess Avery is great
* Taylor why do you refuse to dump that sack of shit, like I know why, but stillllllllll
* Aww they're dancing together and both getting the chance to get spun, way too sweet
* Ugh yeah parents' standards for guys are consistently way too low, both as people to date and as people to assign to their "son" as "friends"
* Once again: fuck Gordo for being such a pushy creep about trying to get Taylor to do sex stuff with him
* Oh no and now he's trying to make Max go to a party too
* Fuck the poor baby is in full shut down panic mode again about how she's the talk of the town, Taylor being ignored when she said Max couldn't make it to the party, the cheer coach trying to meet her, etc.
* fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck the poor girl is basically living a version of a nightmare I used to have about people finding out about me

* The only way out is through indeed, though not at all a situation or plan most people would think of
* Trying to pass over the phone is a hell of a moment of truth, especially when it's for something that actually matters
* Wow, committing to a demo with the coach later that week is just really diving in deep and effectively committing to the party as well, I hope Max can handle it
* Yeah waxing hurts, one of the reasons I've done so much laser
* Oatmeal boobs, that's one of the ideas I tossed around in my head as a kid but never actually tried
* I'm a bit envious, the girl isn't even on hrt yet and a stuffed sports bra and a tuck is enough for her to completely shift others' perception of her
* Whoa, I got tingles from that "you look amazing, Maxine."
* Still I do feel bad for the girl, she's having to dive right into the deep end without having even really figured out anything yet and when effectively under duress
* The girls are already just running on she/her for Maxine, and she's not actually at all uncomfortable about it either it seems which is also great
* Poor girl getting some dysphoria about the "guy smell" now too, it was one of the things I hated the most and was the happiest about when it basically went away within a couple weeks of starting HRT
* If she wasn't flashing neon sign saying "egg!" before the reaction to "you could grow boobs" being "no way that's possible" and not "that would be awful" should really make things obvious to anyone

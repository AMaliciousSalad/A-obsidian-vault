1. Yeah I'd be a bit stunlocked if my best friend suddenly kissed me after clearly being very in her own head for a moment and then ran the fuck away too
2. Max is a natural at this little sister thing isn't she, at least the little sister to a big brother thing, not honestly sure exactly how much and in what ways that differs from little sister to a big sister though
3. Clay is right, especially if she's going to be living with her parents or wants to for the rest of this year she is going to have to talk to them, she's already changing in so many ways that aren't physical and it's better to get out ahead of it instead of getting ambushed by it one day. Doesn't make it any less terrifying
4. Yeah she probably is going to go ballistic, gotta prepare for that too
5. Sorry Garrett Taylor can only think about Max right now, the kiss, and so much more of everything about Max. Oh and now she's on the same worried line of thought I got into. 
6. Good, Max does trust and knows that Taylor doesn't see her as a guy and that her "attraction" to guys isn't why she kissed her either. Yes follow that train of thought, just talk to Taylor about it! Please!
7. Oh goddess is she going to do something dumb like bandaid her nipples to try to dodge the chafing against the shirt?
8. Fucking called it!
9. "No. Taylor can still win this. Taylor can still be the most normal, the most relaxed." Sure you can girlypop, you definitely haven't already failed miserably at that, no not at all.
10. Yeah parents legit hate you telling them the truth unless it magically lines up with what they already thought/believed/want to believe. So you learn to lie to try to keep them as happy as possible, and maybe sometimes when to tell them what they don't want to hear to tear the attention and anger away from your little siblings to try to keep them from getting hurt or at least minimize that hurt. It's still not good for you yourself though, constructing that unreal boy for the sake of a parent does hurt at least a bit.
11. Whoa Taylor is really really down bad right now
12. This conversation is really good, but Tay please don't leave her thinking that *that* kiss was just casual feminine intimacy. And of course she mostly left it at that...... AHHHtahsyehcuomsn
13. Okay at least Max isn't able to really get herself to believe there was nothing more to that kiss and the look Taylor had
14. Willa doesn't quite get what Taylor is meaning when she says she likes Max, this is kinda funny seeing it be Willa being useless this time. But I guess she hasn't been told yet has she, she doesn't know that Maxine is the real Max. Not ideal having it be Taylor explaining it to Willa, but I really don't think Willa would be able to figure it out herself for a long while and I don't know if Max would've thought to explain it to her. Hopefully she really listens to what Tay is trying to tell her instead of thinking this is Max's way of trying to die for real or something. Hmm she's coming over huh, hopefully she isn't going to do something dumb.
15. Oh shit, Avery is messaging Max again. Oh that poor girl, of course she'd be terrified of going back to school. Yes fuck Matty, and yeah you were definitely catching some of that transmisogyny back in NYC Max, I'm so sorry you had to deal with that. I hope this joking about her genitals/balls isn't making her uncomfortable. Oh and Avery is teasing her about how much she obviously is into Taylor. OOF that "You're basically my brother" paired with the "Yeah" stings.
16. The dorkiest girls ever to smoke weed indeed. Oi Willa you had better not take this position.
17. Okay Taylor I'm trusting you to put forward a good argument about this to get Willa to understand why what she said is wrong! Okay Willa seems to recognize it but is still extremely off balance and upset (seemingly mostly with herself.) And now we get a Matrix reference... Alyson is having fun messing with her readers in this story huh. Willa is putting a good effort into working her way through the cognitive dissonance she's got bouncing around in her brain. The segue into Taylor having to explain her sexuality now too, this is a very packed conversation.
18. Okay Willa is still hung up over something, I'm not as certain as Taylor is that it doesn't have anything to do with Max though. 
19. "See what I mean? Lesbianism is adjacent to idiocy." Yes yes it is Willa.
20. OOH Avery has noticed what Taylor said didn't she, interesting choice to message Max while not being direct about it and then deleting it again
21. Holy shit the obsessing over the kiss caught on photo is way too sweet, "One day Taylor's going to show Maxine this picture and tell her that this is when she *knew*" AHHHHHHHHH it's too fucking cute and pure
22. Oh Willa is really scared for her friends, she doesn't want them to get hurt and she's pretty certain getting marked as Lesbians would absolutely get them marked as such, and duh she's in love with Taylor too. I'm fully on board with at minimum a triad with these three
23. I love how nonchalant about loving being a girl Max is, responding to "I gotta ask. I need to check, you know? Max... You're okay with everything, right?" with a big smile and an "I am." followed by "You really prefer being a girl?" with "Don't you?" is so amazing! 
24. "Shit. Taylor Scott realizing she likes girls is such an epochal event, it makes a brand-new one out of the boy next door." This is fucking hilarious. And Willa finally gets that this just is who Max is and is going to be from now on, that shiver and hard "No, never" was the final real nail. (Yeah there was one more exchange but that was just a formality, that never was the real nail)
25. Oh FUCK
26. UGHH so much stress leading up to it and it's about getting fitted for a fucking suit to be able to go to Catholic mass, ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww

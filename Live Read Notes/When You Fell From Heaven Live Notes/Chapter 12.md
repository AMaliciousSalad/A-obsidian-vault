* Lmao Clay love the shirt
* Yeah this is a completely reasonable crashout, poor Max, she's tougher than me though, I'd probably have collapsed into a sobbing and/or screaming mess not stormed off strutting
* OMG Max, "Where are my drinks?" you're fucking wild girl
* Taylor I love you, that threat was beautiful. I'm glad Max is taking charge of this though instead of leaving it with that as the final word. I'm so worried about the conversation tomorrow though.
* Holy shit Max gendered herself correctly for the first time and Taylor pretty much confessed that yes she just sees Max as a girl al in a couple sentences! Can't wait to see how these useless girls manage to not figure anything out thanks to this.
* Yeah assuming I avoid the breakdown I wouldn't be comfy sticking around the club much longer after that happened either. 
* Please don't try to bury yourself even deeper to try to convince Clay like that, or Clay please have noticed the pronoun and make her acknowledge it without freaking out at her about it
* Good for Willa, have some fun with that girl!
* Yes! Taylor admitted she's been into women for a long time and isn't being nearly as confused about what her attraction to Max means anymore, but of course she's catastrophizing now and can't bear the idea of Maxine becoming the Maxwell she thinks is real too but also can't bear the idea of Maxine staying Maxine because she blames herself for the entire thing and somehow still doesn't quite see that Maxine is the one that's actually the real Max. AHHHHHHHH!
* It really hurts reading her denying herself so completely while also so crippled by dysphoria that she can't wash herself properly without locking in her current ideal image in her mind first. Teared up a bit but didn't quite cry about it
* Oh good, that kills the pretending it's drag idea. Thank fuck
* I love how much bitch Max has in her, I've gotta work on that for when I'm dealing with certain individuals and groups of relatives. I've got so much more dirt on a lot of them than they do on me
* Well at least the freak out seems calm so far lol
* You know it's times like this I wonder if my family (immediate and some of my more extended) isn't actually actively trying to gaslight me for once when they say they can't tell much of a difference or say that everyone can tell (or at least not all the time.) Maybe if/when they see me not trying to boymode for the first time that'll snap some sort of sense into them (probably not in a way that makes them suddenly accept me but maybe something at least)
* Garret you've won back a ton of points here man, good fucking job!
* Lots of sharing and arguing about Max, Clay being gay, all that. Sorry I'm kinda engrossed right now and not typing
* Yes hug you two dumbasses! "Maybe I *do* get it." Oh shit is she going to actually maybe admit it or just a bit of it to both Clay and herself?!!!!!!! Okay she's not quite certain what she's feeling yet, that's okay. Realizing that no a "regular straight guy" absolutely wouldn't be okay with being like this (much less on hrt on top of it but she doesn't fully understand that and I don't know if Clay even knows about that yet)
* You've got some interesting timing there Jim
* I love how everyone (except Clay so far) is fully on the "it's absolutely not drag" side of things, even if they don't quite understand why yet
* The story about how Max got the outfit she's wearing is fucking hilarious from this point of view and told this way
* Also Jim I fucking adore you for repeatedly calling Max Clay's sister, not just Max or Maxine, his sister. Max blushing up a storm as she gets showered with compliments and called Clay's sister is insanely cute. (I wish I could blush or flush, but I don't seem capable of it. One upside is that I can be messy crying one minute and the next people actually can't tell unless I'm still sniffling or my makeup is all fucked or something, that's come in handy a couple times)
* OOF, yeah that's a rough corner Jim just accidentally pushed Max into, it's honestly good for her to not try to hide the hormones and what she wants from them from everyone she's close with. Can't blame her for feeling overwhelmed and needing to eat something first though. Good on Jim for putting his foot down to make sure she actually gets that little break and food that she needs.
* Oh this is still a hard thing to explain, I get it girl. My throat has felt like it's dryer than a desert and way too tight to speak when talking to people about some of this stuff too. Also nice, confirmed up to 3 pills a day when she can now! That's making some things click a bit better in Taylor's head now.
* Fuck please Clay, listen to your little sister, she really needs you to accept her right now. 
* Poor Clay too, having to kill or bury or repress a big part of yourself is hell
* And now Max is really trying to look at herself and understand what's going on. And she's maybe not quite nailed it but she understands her brother for the first time in years, maybe ever now and she's happy for him getting to be himself.
* Clay and Max are getting closer to the truth of it but Clay can't quite seem to accept it. Fuck this is still a rough conversation (and Max is going to need to spend more time with Taylor after this because she just had one big realization, then found out that Max has tried to die before, and that the want for that has only been gone for a couple weeks) and Max has made an ultimatum that Clay realistically can't defy.
* Okay, Taylor is actually handling this a lot better than I thought, and both she and Jim are right that Clay needs to be left alone right now
* Hey there's the "transitioning can help relieve that newly heightened/sharpened dysphoria" thing I mentioned before, doubly now that Max is starting to see Maxwell as the costume.
* That's a really cute (probably final?) rejection of that sort of relationship with Jim, I really hope Jim leaves it alone now though, don't go souring my positive view on you by getting all pushy towards Max 
* Oh thank fuck that Clay understands how to search for stuff online better than Max did, this is like really big. 
* And he hugged her, and made her stop trying to explain it away, and called her by her ***Name***

* Poor kid shutting down for a bit once the major threat disappeared 
* I'm so glad the other 3 made her stick around to finish their plans for the evening, it's not good to leave someone alone after something like that
* Taylor making up Max reminds me of this one time I was at a pharmacy with a couple guys and all the girls from my robotics team when at an out of state competition and some of the girls were picking up extra makeup supplies and I muttered something vaguely longing about the makeup and/or the false lashes they were grabbing, the girls said something about doing my face, I'm honestly not sure if they were just messing with me or if they were more serious (a couple of the girls didn't like me much), and I wanted to accept but my parents were at the same event with me and if they noticed anything I was dead so fear won out instead.
* Taylor on and off struggling with what pronouns to use for Max was also really cute, as was seeing her being able to relax and have fun dressing up as a cheerleader
* I want to comfort this girl even more after how she reacted when she woke up with her assumptions about how she must look and that reaction to her reflection, goddess the dysphoria was practically dripping off that scene.
* The use of "zero day exploit" isn't quite right, but it's also one of the closest to right usages I've seen in a book that's not written by someone in cyber security so not a big deal. 
* I love the "eh whatever" attitude towards being seen by Garrett and Banger, really happy for her that Banger didn't even question it, and responding to Garrett asking "weren't you a guy before?" with "possibly" is also great. 
* Well Max you're probably right about the decision being pretty final, just probably not in the way you had in mind.

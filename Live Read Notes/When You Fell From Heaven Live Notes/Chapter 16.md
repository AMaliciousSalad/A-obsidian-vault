1. Yeah the road trip to Cali really does symbolize a path to discovering and getting to be Maxine doesn't it. Definitely hard to maintain that positive framing and gratitude towards her parents for doing it for her (albeit not intentionally for *her*) when you're getting dragged to get fitted for a suit
2. Anyone want to take bets on the tailor reading her as a girl?
3. Well that doesn't seem to have happened so far, but Max is realizing she no longer has a Maxwell to retreat into as a way to hide for stuff like this.
4. Okay nope, he almost certainly has clocked her and is trying to get her dad out to deal with this without him being around.
5. Max is extremely on edge here, can't blame her, I'd be in full panic attack mitigation mode. The tailor is trying to help her relax though, still don't know for sure what's going on in his head though
6. Taylor on the other hand is freaking out at least as much if not more, she's so cute! Thank you Willa for deciding that she needs watching.
7. Trying to imagine that "potential future" is hellish, got caught trying to do the same when that started being described and almost started crying like she did. Yeah this tailor definitely sees *her*.
8. "Max, if you need to take a break, let me know. Until then... We're going to make a man of you." Well that's about as direct a way to say "I'll help you put together this mask girl" as possible without out and saying he knows she's a girl
9. "Didn't she say she was going to be grateful to her parents? It's not a very nice thing to think about their second son." The ways this girl thinks are great. Nothing to do but push through it until it's done Max, I'm sure Taylor is going to have found you by the time you're finished to give you a respite afterwards. Yeah avoiding sarcastically curtsying is probably a good thing, not that it really matters in this situation but for avoiding getting caught in the future.
10. The tailor really basically said "No girl, stand like yourself not *him*." Followed shortly with an "oops. I'm so sorry, didn't mean to irritate your boobs." 
11. Ah now he's done with what he can be subtle about, he's done his best to make her as comfortable as possible but couldn't tiptoe around it forever. Still a bit gross thinking about the "what are you biologically" question, but it's 2003 and he does seem to be trying to do his best to be gentle and respectful. "Are you aware, Max the man, that you wore women's pants to this appointment?" this guy is pretty funny. 
12. Her dad really managed to roll a queer italian american tailor purely by accident, incredible
13. And it's the same fucking tailor that Willa had gone to with Eddie! LMFAO
14. Okay apparently the odds of rolling a gay or otherwise queer tailor aren't that crazy as long as you get a younger one in this area, the fact that it's the same one Eddie and Willa know is still pretty funny though.
15. lol he clocked her real quick all right, just got it backwards initially. Yeah trans woman does have a nice sound to it, especially with the space there like it should be. Aladino really is being a sweetheart. 
16. Taylor trying to maintain Max's cover in front of him while Max has just swapped back into her proper voice is so funny, Aladino knowing does make getting Max ready in time to dodge a potential disaster with Justin that's for sure.
17. Thank you Justin, you might've just given her the perfect out to dodge mass. And brilliant maneuver Max, if Justin is half as decent a guy as he seems to at least wants to be read as he'll know now that she's not interested in a relationship with a guy for now and give her space.
18. That text convo definitely makes me like Justin more
19. Amazing job Max, you made Rosie overjoyed and stun locked Justin by both being stunning and making Rosie that happy.
20. I'm so glad Max got to have a lot of fun with Rosie
21. Yeah it's fucking bullshit needing to get the suit and go to church and the like, and trying to figure out how you're going to handle college is also a minor nightmare to try to figure out
22. No bad Max, don't misgender yourself again. You did literally nothing wrong by having a "girls' day" playing music with Rosie. Listen to Taylor, you're just a girl who had to pretend to be a guy for a while.
23. Oh fuck, yeah the first day of school would be a stress nightmare filled with catastrophizing, she needs to have at least one of her friends on hand. She shouldn't need to face this alone. Thank you Taylor! Make her engage, but also make sure you keep her as comfy as possible at the same time. And she has her other friends with her too and she's *her*

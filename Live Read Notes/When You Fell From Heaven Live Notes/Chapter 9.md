* This chat convo is great, poor Max has absolutely no idea how she's going to handle things with Avery huh, and meanwhile Avery is hilarious and pretty great seeming all around
* So it's confirmed then: Max is intentionally keeping up with taking 1-2 pills a day, I wonder how she'll react when the changes really start happening
* Max really adores Avery, I'm desperately hoping she accepts her when she eventually finds out, I'll be a wreck if she doesn't
* Yeah I'm increasingly convinced that Taylor has never been into her boyfriend as much of anything beyond a way to satisfy expectations and bury various feelings that she isn't properly cognizant of yet
* Lmao Willa playing with Max's breast forms is pretty great, Taylor is adorably jealous and scandalized 
* I really relate to how Max is feeling in her home, even when they weren't being overtly abusive my parents constantly kept their eyes on me when they could, they opened packages and other mail addressed to me, etc. Your only real option is to shut down and put on an act or it's even more completely unbearable.
* She seems to really like (while also being amused) by what the gaff can do for her as well as the bra, can't blame her for being nervous about the idea of a permanent solution to deal with the need for a gaff/tucking when she's not even actualized yet
* Max keeps expecting to get dysphoric or otherwise uncomfortable about seeing herself as herself, but yeah that's not coming girl. Hopefully you'll figure out why sooner rather than later
* It's so cute seeing her basically drunk of euphoria
* Taylor I would also give anything to know what Max was thinking in that moment
* Taking your pills as an anti-stressor huh Max, I wonder what that's about 
* Idk maybe she is a bit more attracted to Gordo than I thought, but it still doesn't seem quite **there**
* It is good for her to be developing who she is outside of just when she's with her anchor, and being a girl clearly comes naturally to her which is good. Hell it seems like both she and Willa forgot that she's not a cis girl for at least a bit there
* AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH, like sure it's under remarkably un-ideal circumstances and at the jeering prompts of a bunch of fetishizing pigs but they kissed!!!!!!!!!!
* fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck, please don't let this guy to anything to Max.
* FUCK, I need to kill this Clinton guy. Poor Max, please please please let someone help her, she's fucking frozen and she's not physically strong enough to escape and FUCK I hate it.
* Thank goodness her friends showed up, but I'm still shaking and breathing too hard. Also, shut up Anna!
* Taylor's not wrong, it's so deeply unfair and wrong that you have to bear your deep vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and trauma and almost use them as a shield even with people you're not ready to let know.
* At least it sounds like there's two maybe decent guys on the football team, but of course they're still lost and almost useless
* Banger really seems good, I'm glad for that.
* Max is right, it's just so much better with the girls, sure there are shitty girls too but it's just more real and idk how to find the words.
* Really a shitty catalyst to have for starting to self actualize, I wish it hadn't had to be as awful as that for her.

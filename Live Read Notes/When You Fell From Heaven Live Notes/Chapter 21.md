1. Dammit that's right. Their parents were actively shopping for the "right" church weren't they. Now I'm feeling even more sick, because like this type of shit had to have been a part of that criteria right?????
2. Of course the church hasn't gotten any better about any of this shit since the early 2000s, if anything they've gotten worse. Having gay marriage legalized across the country if anything has encouraged both the leaders of the church in the US and in the Vatican to turn up the "the forces of evil are all arrayed against us and are corrupting even our greatest strongholds" shit.  
3. And yeah Maxine is right, this has just effectively outed Clay, also confirmed at least some things about her to her parents. 
4. Fucking stressful car ride and conversation, it's such bullshit that it's both happening in the story and happens so many times every day irl.
5. Yeah Tay it is good that Kennedy doesn't seem to have figured out Max's other secret, just because she's chill with the lesbians doesn't mean she'd be cool with trans women unfortunately.
6. Tay keeps on finding new ways to prove that yes she's very very gay. She doesn't let that stop her from being a "normal" good caring friend to the girls around her though (not that it intrinsically would but she's good at almost completely banishing the horny when someone needs help.)
7. I'm shaking so much right now after that confrontation, or maybe two confrontations that're linked but not the same. Amazing how so many of those things Clay and Maxine said match or at least rhyme with some of the things my parents should be told, maybe just another indicator that unfortunately at least some of the shit I've had to deal with concerning my parents isn't nearly as unique as I'd wish it to be. Nobody should have to go through that, and if I had to then it's even more the case that nobody else should have to before or after.
8. Come on Jim, "Your brother's cute when he's sad" is both very funny and not all that appropriate in the moment. Still love you though!
9. Lol Maxine stumbling into the idea that they'd be making out as a way to comfort Clay. I think while Jim might be a bit odd with choice of when and how to tease Max he knows better than to try to take advantage of her sad and hurting brother like that
10. Not a bad story to explain what she was doing when *that* went down at the church, she doesn't really have any better options at least.
11. This family stuff fucking sucks, every moment of it. That's part of how you can tell it's written so very well. Of course Avery's also in a bad spot and not online. At least a moment was taken to have levity by making fun of Skype for a minute
12. Yes Gordo got punched in the face! I really needed something good to happen!
13. I'm very worried about Avery, did she do something stupid like start to hitchhike all the way to where Maxine is?
14. Not your first gay club eh Kennedy
15. Clay and Taylor and Max all talking like this is so good. I'm tearing up again.
16. Okay Avery hasn't done anything quite that dumb yet. That's good, I'm worried that this bounce back she's showing isn't actually very good though. It's very much giving "oh someone else has/had it worse so I shouldn't get to acknowledge the shitty stuff happening to me." Which is a line of thinking I've spent far too much of my life trapped in.
17. Yeah that was some pretty extreme edge case luck to end up in Taylor's life and almost immediately have to "pretend" to be a girl. Girl had to roll a jackpot after getting the absolutely shit roll with what happened to her at her old school
18. I can't even be cautiously optimistic about Max's parents right now. Dad might be halfway or all the way serious but I don't believe the Mom really is. I want to be but I can't.
19. Can't wait to see how homecoming blows up next.

1. Okay opening on Taylor and her mom having a good time chatting together for a moment when I still have the end of the last chapter with Maxine and her mom frozen in my mind is a thing
2. I wonder what Taylor wants to grab. She sure seems to be thinking mostly about how much she loves that she was able to do more with Maxine last night, I'm sure those moans you drew out of her were wonderful.
3. Okay she wanted to grab her laptop, but that couldn't override having to take a minute to stare at pictures of Maxine longing for the moment that she can see her again. Can't make her stop thinking about the sex either apparently.
4. I wonder what Taylor is hoping she can show her mom.
5. Lauren's email writing style is so incredibly upbeat. I hope we'll get to spend some more time with her in the story sometime, she seems fun. 
6. I can't tell for sure if Taylor is pulling her mom's leg with that explanation for "Lolz" if she's somehow telling the truth about Lauren's usage of it I'll be very very confused though.
7. That sounds like an incredible action shot. I love and am very envious of Taylor and her Mom's dynamic.
8. Okay so it's the pictures she wanted to show her Mom not that she's in love with Maxine, though even though she says she's not ready for her Mom to know that she's not doing a remotely good job of hiding it. Maxine is awful at boymoding and Taylor is equally awful at hiding how much she loves Maxine (especially when she's around people she likes/is pretty comfortable around)
9. Lauren is right: when you've seen one high school boy in a suit, you've seen them all.
10. And yeah you've just gotta get pictures of all the girls!
11. Those two drama club girls are definitely in lesbians.
12. Talking about Avery went well too. Though the talking about how Avery was treated "just for being different" and her desire to protect Taylor from that is both very imperfect and has a lot of implications. She's right though: people can be so very cruel.
13. Okay back to Maxine. This'll probably hurt.
14. Fucking hell, let go of her! What the fuck is wrong with you?!?!
15. Breathe Alice breathe.
16. Thank you Avery! Thank fuck you're trying to help pull her off Maxine. Please tell me Clay is home and can help. Oh thank goodness, he is here. Keep her away from Maxine.
17. Avery just ignore Gina. Focus everything on taking care of Maxine. Gina doesn't deserve a fucking answer to that question or any other one.
18. Dad G you'd better not make this any fucking worse than it is right now.
19. Oh hi Nique, talking to Taylor about what's going on with Kennedy now are you?
20. Are you sure you know that Nique? Like yeah straight girls wanting to love girls instead and finding it doesn't work out is a thing, but are you really that certain? Also "she likes guys just as much as I do" doesn't carry much weight with how you sometimes act towards Maxine. 
21. I'm sorry Nique but guys don't stop being jerks after high school, if anything they get worse a lot of the time, that almost certainly won't change anything about the "guys you tried to date ended up being jerks" thing.
22. Oh no, it was Nique's mom that talked to Gina. At least Taylor knows that's what her Mom is almost certainly talking about now
23. Good job getting that fact out there first Clay. I don't love Dad G dragging Gina around like that either, but I'm having a hard time caring that much right now.
24. Yes just breathe Maxine, just breathe.
25. Hey another person in the "Jim" club! It just is better than "Banger."
26. Honestly not an awful way to handle punishing those piece of shit guys, but yeah I'd recommend pushing for harsher punishment.
27. Oh and the "she's calling the parents of everyone who was involved in an incident" sunk in fully the second time she was made aware of it. She's absolutely terrified for Maxine right now, and is rushing to get to her.
28. Okay at least Maxine is past the worst of the initial panic attack right now. I can't blame her for being mostly frozen even if she's certain that she should be trying to grab all her stuff and GTFO. It's just all too much all at once and it's almost impossible to act in that sort of situation.
29. You didn't fuck up Maxine, you just fell victim to procedure around what to do when a student is harassed at a school thing and there's literally nothing you could've done to prevent that.
30. Fuck, I adore Clay so much. He will protect his little sister and he'll stand up to anyone it takes to do so.
31. Well listening to this voicemail won't be stressful at all.
32. You'll survive this Maxine. You have your brother and Avery with you and Taylor probably ready to burst in any minute now, they will not allow anything to happen you. You'll get battered a bit by this massive wave, but with them you'll come out on the other side with the world opened up to you again (as much as it can be at least.)
33. Jasmine, you're a sweetheart but damn, you sure didn't leave Maxine any wiggle room with how you talked about her on that message. 
34. Dammit it's so incredibly unfair that you don't just get to have that normal family life that you so desperately want. At least not with your birth parents.
35. It's unfair I didn't get that either, and so many of the rest of us too. I want to find a way to make it so that it doesn't happen to any more of us but I just can't even imagine how to start.
36. You're under no obligation to respond to Gina's question Maxine. It's okay to cry, Avery and Clay will hold you and protect you for as long as you need. 
37. But no, you're in the midst of reliving so many of your traumas at once so it's impossible to trust in that right now and you're spiraling. So you run, because what else can you do.
38. There's Taylor there to do whatever she can to help you. Even if right now that's just to make sure that you have another person on your side to hold you while it feels like everything is ending.
39. "Little clues, such as the fact that Maxine is in her arms, sobbing so hard she literally can't stand unaided, or the fafct that Avery is rushing over to help support Maxine while Clay is using his size to block the door to the living room." Fuck you for making me let out a bit of a giggle at the start of that.
40. Good shit Taylor, standing up to Luca and stating that she's going to clean Maxine up. The "okay" is just there for politeness, it wasn't an offer it was a statement. 
41. It's good that you didn't try to fight Taylor on that Luca, and being quieter with Maxine while saying he intends to talk to her without Gina being there is about as good as I could hope for given the situation.
42. Yeah making sure the screwdriver isn't around is a good idea, don't want to give her parents any ideas about deep searching things that need tools to get into.
43. Taylor can't stop being wowed by Maxine even in moments like this huh. At least she isn't treating Maxine like the broken doll she somewhat resembles at the moment, and is instead embracing her, telling her that she loves her, and promising to defend her too.
44. Maxine may be trying to engage in dark humor and attempting that is a good sign that she's at least able to function a bit, but also there's no religion in history that has engaged in as much femicide for this sort of shit as Catholicism (and other sects of Christianity). The fact that the Catholic church is almost never mentioned in discussions about "honor killings" will always disgust me in no small part because a lot of the criteria used to say something is an "honor killing" are basically just a laundry list of racist and western-supremacist tropes so Catholicism is excluded by default.
45. Gonna go back to my "don't rant about religion and this one in particular" self restriction again though. 
46. Taylor is handling this great though, keeping Maxine talking while having it as lighthearted as possible, and thanks in part to that Maxine is ready at least in part to stand up for herself.
47. Yep not having to do the stupid mustache thing again is an upside!
48. Fingers crossed that Luca behaves himself. The fact that he didn't blow up on seeing Maxine being mostly herself appearance wise, calmly asked if Maxine was forced into it or chose to do it herself, and followed that up with "just" asking her to explain everything without Taylor taking over much of the story are at least somewhat positive indicators that he's at least willing to listen.
49. Well so far her dad doesn't seem to understand much of anything, but it's at least let her recover enough to have more of her confidence back. Because yeah Luca can't argue that it's impossible that the people she knows would be able to tell, and it doesn't matter if Luca and Gina don't want her to keep being herself because unless they really do want to get her potentially killed they can't do anything about it.
50. Yes it is a for life thing, and if you can't accept her then all that does is confirm what she already thought the end result of this would be instead of being a pleasant surprise, like she said: you cannot stop her from leaving.
51. Oh I really hate that question Luca asked, I'm half surprised that Maxine didn't throw up on the spot. Taylor fielded the question as well as she could though.
52. If you want her in your life then no you absolutely do "gotta do anything." Stop being a man and try being a person instead. 
53. Yep, even if Clay being gay is something that Luca can accept in part thanks to the growing acceptance of gay people (and especially gay men at this point in time,) that doesn't mean much of anything regarding if he's likely to be able to accept his trans daughter.
54. Goddess that whole fucking outpouring is so incredibly raw. I can't break it into bits, it's just everything.
55. Yeah no shit you never understood her before! And no what possible angle would there be for a fraud argument? 
56. I wish I didn't know that same certainty Maxine has right now about the fact that she'd be dead or soon to be dead without this, but no I know all too well that for at least the last 19 months every day is a day I wouldn't have had otherwise. 
57. I hate the fact that she felt that asking for a hug could somehow be manipulative even for a second.
58. I'm glad he hugged her, I don't know the last time I had a real hug with my parents. Actually I don't know if I ever have had one. All I can remember are instances where I was obligated or it just felt like the safest decision.
59. Yep she does smell different, it's much more than just the clothes, she looks more and more like her mom ever passing day, and she doesn't have any obligation to tell him what it is she's doing
60. My parents also said something along the lines of "we don't want to lose you," but that was accompanied by so many words making it clear that *he* was the one they didn't want to lose, not me, and most of the time they deign to acknowledge anything it's to make sure that I can never forget that they don't want to lose *him*.
61. Uh oh, Taylor's mom is here now too, and yeah she knows at least part of what's going on with Maxine now too.
62. Oh Garrett is here too, guess this is just turning into a whole house party at this point.
63. Of course Gina would start blaming Lynn for this in some way. Hopefully Lynn really listens to Taylor here. Thank you! It's really just that simple: they just came to realize that she's just Maxine. The "other guy" was just a costume she was trapped in.
64. This just popped into my mind: I guess the forged permission signature for joining the cheer squad could maybe count as fraud.
65. "Why wouldn't I?" Lynn I love you, don't fuck this up after that moment.
66. I have never heard the turn of phrase "looking like butter wouldn't melt" before. 
67. You go Lynn! Literally standing up for Maxine and facing Gina down!
68. "I've already got to suck it up with Clay" well I see someone has given up on not burning every bridge in her life.
69. "Clay saved him for *this*? This… *joke?*" I feel fucking sick.
70. Partially because I have trouble believing either of my parents would behave any differently in this situation.
71. Lynn I'm sorry if I've ever doubted you for a moment, right now you're basically a dream come to life: outraged at how Gina could've possibly all but said she wishes Maxine had died instead; unwilling to let Gina pretend that it wasn't a big deal; calling out damn near exactly why Maxine knew she couldn't tell her mother; just flat out stating that Gina is a bad mom; taking that slap like it's nothing;  just laying down that she is going to be taking care of Maxine for at least tonight; makes sure that Maxine has the chance to grab everything that she needs before she goes; and makes it clear that she will press charges for the assault if it becomes necessary to protect Maxine. 
72. Maybe Maxine can't have the mom that she was hoping for but she sure as hell seems like she has/will have a real mom now.
73. Yes the physical contact and comforting is just everything Max, it's insane just how much it helps.
74. Well Gina is making absolutely certain that she keeps digging that hole, won't even listen to a word her daughter says.
75. Somehow I don't think Avery cares if she's dead to you Gina.
76. Good for you Maxine, you really shouldn't feel like you have to give a shit about whatever your dad manages to talk Gina into. She's made it clear that she has no intention to even listen to you, much less be your mother in any way that matters and it's out of your hands at this point.
77. Very nice and speedy gathering of all of Maxine's important stuff Taylor!
78. "And you don't know what you're giving up" Lynn 😭 <3
79. Good luck Clay! I don't envy you trying to put up with that for even another minute.
80. And there goes the last of the adrenaline, I'm glad it happened before she was actually on the stairs or somewhere she was more likely to get hurt when she collapsed.
81. You know what, Garrett knows he's not any good at this emotional stuff so opting to try to help by putting some coffee on is a good move from him.
82. Yeah it's fair that Lynn would have some things to be ticked off about, and yeah Taylor's been doing a lot of lying and taking stupid risks that's for sure. As you just realized choosing not to tell anyone makes way more sense than you might like.  
83. I guess it was too much to hope for that Maxine would just be able to live there for a while, but the feasibility is low especially with Gina being literally right next door.
84. Somehow I think that a lot of the question that Taylor needs to answer are more related to why she made so many risky decisions and when she was planning on letting Lynn know that she likes girls, is in love with Maxine, and is dating Maxine (as I assume that all came out in the rundown Garrett gave her) rather than grilling her about any of the more particular details of Maxine being Maxine.
85. Lynn is basically refusing to let Maxine take any of this out on herself, and though she acknowledges that she's somewhat upset that Maxine wasn't honest about everything with her and that she wishes both Maxine and Taylor had been more careful, she also makes it very clear that she understands why and doesn't blame her for it.
86. Compared to what "pissed at you" means in Maxine's family it's almost just a lighthearted way of saying "we will have to talk/deal with this" with the Scotts.
87. Taylor's right, Avery will almost certainly be having to fill in any details that Lynn feels she needs to know right now, and there's no reason to backslide at Taylors house of all places.
88. "You two are together, aren't you?" "Yah-huh!" lmao

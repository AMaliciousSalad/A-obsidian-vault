* Taylor is adorably worried about giving Max HRT and what she's thinking about this whole thing right now
* Maxine clearly has fun getting to pose with her hands on her hips
* Yeah can't blame the girl for having nerves, even when I moved somewhere I felt I could safely "girlmode" it took me a few days to actually do it
* Oh no not crock pot lasagna, a true bastardization of one of my favorite things to cook
* Uh oh, Taylor's mom is confused and a bit suspicious
* Yep Taylor, Max is a girl to your mom now pretty much forever that's just a bit locked in now
* Yeah being perceived is fucking nerve-wracking/terrifying even if you're just being perceived the same as just about any other girl
* The other girls are just rattling off things she needs and Max seems slightly overwhelmed
* Ugh poor Max: eating disorders are always tough subjects, and you can rationalize the hell out of them in so many ways. I've gone through the ringer with bulimia (mostly the exercise variety because I apparently don't have the right gag reflex for the other one) and binge ed and wouldn't wish either on anyone.

* Yeah Max is very much stuck with things now, she doesn't really have any other ways out and it's clearly terrifying her
* This girl has almost no self worth, it really hurts emotionally but also my chest is so tight right now
* Taylor is so good and caring, I'm so glad Max has someone like her to be able to be open with, even if it hurts/is embarrassing at times
* Oh yeah I sometimes get the faint/vision blacking out thing too, though I don't think it's a not eating enough thing, I know my maintenance calorie requirements and what I'm actually eating most days (harder to keep track on days where I don't eat my own cooking)
* I wonder how long this "we can hang out at your place so you have somewhere you can be a guy around us" thing will be something Max considers even vaguely positive
* Dresses do feel like an extra commitment/statement, they're also harder (for me at least) to feel confident I look good in. Can't blame Max for feeling uncertain about wearing one to the party
* Willa clocked that infatuation Max has for Taylor in no time flat
* The idea of wearing glitter to cheer being what psychs Max out a bit about makeup for cheer is  pretty funny
* Taylor is so freaking gay for Maxine, girl vaguely sees her walk past while trying to imagine what a top would look like on her and can only think about how beautiful she'd look in it
* Yay she saw herself in the mirror again and realized she just looks like any average woman! Sure it freezes her for a minute but that's not a bad thing in this case I don't think.

* Taylor is really putting a heroic effort into trying to see Max as a guy, but she's not really even close to succeeding properly
* Wow Max is just getting to drown in mirror moments isn't she, that's two in like a couple minutes tops
* Max is a natural at flustering the hell out of Taylor, it's so incredibly cute
* Ahhh Max can't see Maxwell in the mirror anymore! (I'm absurdly jealous)
* Good for her seeing through the "herbal hormone supplement" bs
* Pftt the girl really found a small army of excuses to ignore the "only take like 3 of the pills a week" and has now taken 2 in a day

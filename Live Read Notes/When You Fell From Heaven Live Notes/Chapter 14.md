1. Taylor is opening strong by being completely stunlocked by how incredibly lucky she is to have Max here with her doing this, and she comes in with the title drop while mentally babbling to herself about Max and how she's going to protect her!
2. Lol yeah you never would've been able to even begin to fit in as a guy cheerleader Max, this is very clearly much better!
3. Getting to meet all the other girls in cheer and having them all pretty much immediately accept and voice support for her is great
4. Very unsurprising that she would have nerves around some of the other "A-listers" especially with how Avery is being treated by a different set of them
5. The energy with this first "unofficial" practice session is starting off great, though "grilling balls instead of burgers" feels almost more like it belongs on a mug
6. Good girl, American football is stupid and not worth learning anything about outside of like Jon Bois videos
7. Ewwwww Gordo checking out Max is making my skin crawl just thinking about it. 
8. Yay her first practice went off well! She feels like she belongs and it's such a very special feeling to get to experience. And she got to fly again!
9. Fuck, I want to be able to forget for at least a moment and just be me without any of the other thoughts on my mind, that sounds like a completely wonderful and stress free way to just get to exist for a bit. At least until it ends and you remember all the annoying complications in your life
10. Dammit, that snap back from that belonging to being torn away and isolated, and this time it's the girls who can't quite help her even by offering her to come with them anyway because how could they?
11. Fuck and the backsliding into Maxwell again as she has to go and be separate from the other girls.
12. Now now Kennedy, it's not a 'borderline-lesbo' relationship. It just is one
13. So she did notice Max's mood just completely collapse from being on top of the world to not even herself anymore. 
14. Whoa a bodycon top when she's only a couple weeks on HRT? That's a very bold choice, glad it still looks good on her though!
15. Yeah not surprising that Tay's confused by how Max has suddenly become so fragile, and she's right it can't just be memories of the incident (and it isn't)
16. It's good that some of the other girls want to spend some more time with Max, make sure she's okay, and is able to start her life at the school as comfortably as possible
17. Shit, she's still shrunken into Maxwell and is imposter syndrome spiraling really badly. She's othering, excluding, and monstering herself with every sentence she thinks
18. And of course the other girls have all noticed that she's almost completely shutting herself off right now. Taylor is right about at least some of it, maybe most of it, Max is just very much at her most alive when she's flying. It's just that sometimes just being around Taylor is almost like flying for her too. 
19. The awful thing is that to a certain extent Taylor is othering Max too as she's being so very delicate with her right now. Hopefully Max doesn't pick up on it, or react poorly about it. Fuck, yeah it seems like she might have picked up on it just a bit. At least Taylor has seen a good glimpse of the imposer syndrome, hopefully she can find a way to understand it a bit and maybe even help.
20. Like "I love the girls. But I'm not one of them, am I" is driving a hot spike through my heart. 
21. The dysphoria is striking her really hard right now, and she's hurting herself. She's hurting herself mentally really badly, but she's also doing little physical self harms now too.
22. I'm glad she has a proper big brother to be able to lean on again. This still fucking sucks though, also the Kurt Cobain thing is a really unfair meta move at the very least Alyson. 
23. Yeah this really fucking hurts, I've been right there so many times. Hell more often than not I was the one being my only real jailor, forcing myself to stay at arm's length from my friends, gotta stay back, can't really be one of them, can't make them feel unsafe around me. Gotta be him because otherwise everything comes apart, can't be him because it's unbearable and he's not real in the first place anyway not as more than a costume, but he's there like a haunted doll pulling at you and keeping you from being able to run - able to fly. Just can't really seem to get rid of him either as just like the doll he always finds his way back and makes it all feel impossible again.
24. And Clay is really trying, he's claiming her as his sister because that is what she is and he loves her as his sister too, and it's working it's making it real to her. Fuck I want my other "self" to really die too like Maxwell just did. 
25. Ha you don't need/get to be the one to make things better this time Taylor, she's already just Maxine again, and she's (hopefully) the only one still here from now on. 
26. Taylor is (rightfully) over the moon at the realization that Max is just herself at home now too (at least when her parents aren't around.) The little bits of smalltalk/bantering are so good, and Max's uniforms came in! Clay is being so fantastic too, I'm tearing up again but this time they feel more like happy tears.
27. And Max is putting it all into words fairly well!!!!! Taylor is also being so good about her too, and they're both on the same page that Maxine is/should be here to stay and they both want it that way!
28. Pffftt, Max just made Taylor the happiest girl in the universe entirely by accident and Tay does not know how to handle that
29. Max is making jokes about how she might get a bit shorter too! 
30. Lmao Tay just can't keep herself from trying to catch peeks of every bit of Max can she, can't keep herself from admitting it either in the most awkward ways imaginable. Fortunately that helps break tension
31. And she did it again! At least it worked as a way to dispel any latent "real girl" hang-ups about Max, she now knows that she really does see her as the real girl she is. Maybe be a bit better about not peeping on her though
32. Well sorry Max's mom, you won't ever see your "son" again as she's actually your daughter. But sure you can have dinner with her
33. Good job shutting that creep up Justin! 
34. Yeah Max doesn't know how to deal with or really recognize people liking her yet, much less being very attracted to her, even less attracted to her as the pretty girl she is. That's one of the really weird things to try to get a hold of. Though a good bit of this is Taylor being really jealous. 
35. Speaking of Justin, I wonder if/when Avery is going to notice the "her" that Taylor let slip when mentioning him asking after Max, would be hilarious if she just shows up in person one day in a bit of a panic without addressing any of it beforehand
36. Good job shutting down the "well if all guys are a bit like this then am I..." bullshit there Tay, that was a hard thing for me to learn to drop.
37. And a second time when Max couldn't let it fully go, very nice job Taylor! AHHHHHHHH she kissed her again, and far more for real! God I hope this doesn't make Max think Taylor is thinking of her as a guy despite everything.

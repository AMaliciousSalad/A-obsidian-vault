* The contrast between Taylor freaking out about what happened to Max while not being able to really put a finger on Max's gender, and the way Max is behaving right now is really something
* Okay Taylor is finally accepting that she really can't see Max as anything but a girl anymore, that's a good step imo.
* This opening up to each other is good
* I should maybe take note of these girl rules Taylor is about to list off too. I really don't want to risk going through any of ***that*** again more than I have to, and nowadays with pretty much everybody just seeing me as a girl I'm probably more of a target than back then (at least I think those guys probably thought I was just a boy then)
* lol yeah the one guy I've kissed (though in my case at least it was consensually) also had not the greatest breath, really put a bit of a damper on things
* Unfortunate that the "rules" got cut a bit short, but I understand not wanting to write out an actual big list, it's bad for pacing at the very least
* Dammit of course the poor girl is feeling dysphoric at the thought of having to be *him* again, the way this scene is written almost feels like a suicide scene, it's so fucking unfair that the dysphoria gets worse or at least sharper when you start to actualize (at least for a while, transitioning helps.)
* Ugh I hated how weird my parents were about me being friends with almost exclusively girls too, sometimes they'd call my friend group my "harem" and I'd feel nauseous for hours afterwards.
* Clay at least seems to properly care, but he doesn't know what to do or how to help
*  Taylor and Willa's phone conversation is a lot, and Taylor just going out and telling Willa that she "just" sees Max as a girl would probably help with this whole disconnect them seem to be having
* And Taylor is almost completely right, Max did talk about it and experience it just like any other girl, but not because she "kinda" is. She just is.
* Fuck, poor Max. I've been there with those kinds of nightmares (complete with embodying different versions of me and sometimes having *that* version of me that my parents wanted participating or watching) and it's absolutely hellish, though it was usually over the course of like a nightmare or two a night for like a week not that many in one night/day.
* It's good Max is able to recognize that some guys aren't like *that*, being wary around guys is unfortunately a fairly good safety measure/instinct but it's almost impossible to function when you can't bear being around any of them.
* So she's just consistently on at least 2 pills a day now, one in the morning and one in the evening
* Clay is really trying, but he really just doesn't know quite what to do, doesn't help that he probably can't imagine what's actually going on and would be even less likely to know how to handle that
* Max is impressively brave being willing to pull off her plan for the mall trip, and it's really cool that she's able to recognize that people do *see* her as being her
* Come the fuck on Jim, that's at best a really fucking awful joke. Why do even seemingly decent guys always manage to be so stupid sometimes? Also come the fuck on Garrett, whyyyyyy
* So much of this is just "oh hey do you remember the visceral crushing fear and anxiety you felt your entire fucking childhood Alice? Well here's another girl, but she's not been quite as careful (or able to be careful in the first place) and she can remind you of all of it!"
* At least Jim is trying to make up for his absurdly massive fuckup, but still fuck him for putting Max in the horrible mind space where she's completely lost a lot of her confidence and doesn't know how she's being perceived anymore, though also bless him for realizing at least part of what's going on in her head and trying to help clear it
* She's getting closer to realizing more important things about herself, but still doesn't seem quite there
* Trying to explain to Jim why she needs the birth control pills will probably be "fun," I hope it goes well if we don't get to read it
* Well at least she finally broke up with Gordo, I wish it hadn't been in such a sketchy situation but it's good that she has done it
* I can't relate to not being able to understand why presentation and the like can help you feel better (at least not for the reasons Max can't), but I can definitely imagine it and at best it would make my head hurt badly though would probably just be like having a word on the tip of my tongue that could fix (or at least help with) "everything" and not being able to find it: completely agonizing
* Hey she called herself a girl! She didn't seem to have internalized it yet but that's a step in the right direction, same with declaring she wouldn't change the past so this didn't happen
*  Jim is ahead of the game on teasing trans girls for someone who doesn't seem that familiar with us, we definitely have a tendency to overshare the moment we feel comfy enough to share at all, especially if we get prompted to share (lol look at some of the shit in my notes for this chapter so far for examples)
* Lmao I got little shivers from Jim calling Max "good girl" I am so completely not beating the subby/bottom allegations huh
* Good man, don't let this girl try to get home on her own, especially not this late at night.
* Can't blame Max for not wanting to be seen as *him* by Jim even if he already knows that *he* technically exists, admitting that she cares is another big step though even if she doesn't know why yet!
* Now that's what you're supposed to do Jim, let her know that she is/can still be ***her*** even when she's not wearing the girl armor to make it undeniable! Also yeah letting her know that she won't really be able to hide it through anything other than the whole "gradual changes making some things seem invisible to the people constantly around you" thing is probably a good thing, as is making sure she knows what the pills will actually be doing for her (and yes she's accepting/excited for it!)
* Yeah Taylor guys suck so fucking much about this sort of thing way too much of the time
* lmao "I won't give you away" he says, then almost gives things away every time he opens his mouth while also not being able to even slightly conceal he's attracted to Max to the point where Clay just out and asks Max if she's gay (well yes, but not the way Clay meant it)
* The way Tay is practically desperate to have Max by her side at just about all times is so freaking sweet it almost makes my teeth hurt
* This whole thing with the two girls being able to talk with and comfort each other like this is really making me want to become friends with more girls my age, like the older women I'm close with are great (older in this case being like 6-8 years older at the lower end) but it feels like there's something just a bit different I could have with girls closer to my age (not just this sort of high school type stuff of course)
* Okay that's an entirely insufficient cliffhanger to end off an Alyson chapter/book, was she even trying to make the readers itch for it?

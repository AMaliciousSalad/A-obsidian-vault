1. Gotta hydrate properly when you're drinking Tay, I've had way too many drinks from time to  time and that's always saved me from getting hung over. Making sure to eat also helps, but water and/or electrolyte drinks are the real key
2. That barely starting to wake into almost immediately passing out is really cute. 
3. Well Maxine, you were right that Taylor really wants to pleasure you as thoroughly as you've pleasured her, better tell her just how nice she was able to make your boobs feel so she knows that's a very viable alternative target.
4. Or maybe you have and it's just that she really wants to perform oral on you? Not 100% sure
5. Well I guess it would make sense that if Willa (crushing hard on Taylor and at least a bit on Maxine) and Avery (crushing/crushed hard on Maxine, not enough info on what she thinks about Taylor) think they can't have any of the others they might as well enjoy themselves together.
6. Idk Maxine, I think it's perfectly reasonable for Taylor to tease Avery using her tongue
7. Oh yeah Willa's definitely got a decent crush on Maxine, that disappointment at not getting scolded is yet another bit of evidence to toss on the pile.
8. Yeah if Avery is going to make it to the dance she really needs to get the pronouns down very well
9. I'm very envious of Maxine's ability to sing in her voice, I think I still have a good ways to go to get that down. Like sure I don't think I'm getting any weird looks at the chorus thing I'm doing now but there's also like 20 something other people singing at the same time so that probably is helping disguise my slipups
10. Just casually popping your hormones in front of the best friend who's still wrapping her head around the whole thing. Honestly that's probably a good way to make it more real
11. It's so cute how Avery is both bragging and teasing Maxine by telling her she had sex with Willa. Also it's pretty clear to me that Maxine prefers the full version of her name at the moment at least so I'll be sticking with that for now.
12. Taylor is such a little shit, it's great. Willa seems to be even more confused by the idea of herself having sex than Maxine was.
13. You can kill someone with a desert spoon more easily/quicker than you might think, still harder than most movies would make it out to be though
14. With the last time and this taken together Willa is 1000% giving poly girl who doesn't quite realize it, can't really resist how she feels, thinks it must be inherently wrong of her, and beats herself up about it. Like yeah her poor communication regarding this stuff isn't great either but I do feel for her here.
15. Avery and Maxine seem to have really built up their banter abilities off of each other. Their styles are very similar, but also distinct
16. Yeah Avery, I know using your brain is hard for athletes. If I can do it when I'm on athletic kicks for extended periods of time you can do it too
17. Avery is very very overwhelmed by being surrounded by all these very gay cheerleaders. They have roughly 0 filter when around friends who *know* and I think she's used to being the one who can throw people for a loop. Having deep throated her own foot can't be helping her mental stamina here either.
18. "It rhymes with 'plucked'" Maxine you always have the very best one-liners
19. I'm not sure the "make a pic of Avery and Maxine kissing with Maxine wearing the suit for the sake of fooling Gina" idea is actually that good. It's got at least as many downsides as potential upsides, including but not necessarily limited to: risking other people who shouldn't be seeing that photo seeing it and having Gina think that if Avery's straight for Maxine then maybe Clay can get turned straight.
20. You only brought a single pair of beat up old sneakers cross country? Girl you're a bit crazy.
21. Your inner Kennedy needs some development there Tay, you've gotta go more for the "eating pussy" or "sucking cunt." "Licking vaginas" is just a bit too tame.
22. Finding out that she paints her toenails was the final key to internalizing that Maxine is really truly real for you Avery? It was that of all things??????
23. Ah so you have realized just how dumb the "if I let myself go for Maxine I might trick her into wanting to stay a girl" thing was Tay, that's good
24. Wait Taylor hadn't info dumped the results of her Maxine fueled trans research obsession to Avery yet? That's legitimately kinda surprising
25. Maxine is a saint, now just please suddenly learn that being poly is a thing and have whether to accept that idea be the decision that Willa should be thinking about. Also good telling her that she needs to stop self flagellating by calling herself a bitch.
26. Even voices can be deceptive Willa, I've met several cis men and women that consistently get misgendered off their voices on the phone and the like.
27. Clown car is thriving, Taylor's crushing on Avery now too
28. We need a girl cuddle pile for Maxine asap
29. It is pretty nice knowing your guy mode is so insanely unconvincing that it's funny. Especially when it's so thoroughly unconvincing to someone who actually saw you as a guy until like a few hours ago or so.
30. Yeah I really don't like that "Yeah, Yeah. That's it."
31. "*Like* it? I feel like a fucking idiot for ever thinking you were a guy." I'd like to give someone who used to know me a reaction like that sometime. 
32. A trans girl giving a cis girl the "welcome to womanhood" line is so fucking good, also pretty good having the cis girl voice the thought we usually don't get to (depending on context): "I'm going to bury you in the fucking woods"
33. Eddie's mom is great, just tells him to give her a heads up in advance if/when he comes out, and makes a point of telling everyone in their party that she supports them too (I hope that'll also be the case if/when she finds out Maxine is trans.) 
34. Watch it come out that it was Gina being a busybody at/towards the PTA
35. Yeah it fucking sucks that you're not "supposed" to get those sorts of special moments when you're not straight. That's not always the case everywhere anymore but it's still the case in far too many places too much of the time.
36. Fuck, poor Merry. Having a panic attack right before an event is the worst, and I'm unfortunately speaking from several experiences.
37. "Even Max's *lesbian friend* is hotter than me." Sorry Merry but you'll have to be more specific
38. Well Avery sure got her head in the game there, and Merry was very much not unhappy about that either. 
39. Yep Taylor, you put a pretty butchy lesbian in a nice dress and some very hot boots. Might not be her first choice, but now she's going to be even more dangerous to all the girls that aren't quite ready for her to be all butchy with it. Y'all've made a monster for the night
40. Okay Shannon you and I both know that level of color variety is giving either high fashion (which with the dress you're wearing isn't an option) or very not straight. I really want to know how to do a look like that too Max.
41. Merry is so fucking pumped about getting kissed by a girl, and Justin is excited for her too. Yeah it's kinda giving the way it was at Justin's party, but given Merry's immediate reaction to getting kissed by Avery and Justin's pretty consistent coolness I think they're actually probably being fairly sincere (though playing it up a bit)
42. Eh we can do without an apology to Maxine's mom, but the fact that Nique's mom is pitching a guy for Clay is pretty great way to make up for it. The fact that she didn't react poorly at all to Maxine saying she'll hold off on the message to her mom is also a green flag. The "because" responses to Nique aren't great though
43. Pfft Kennedy, you are so incredibly dramatic. Love you for it though. 
44. Hmm, is she having a bit of a "done with guys" moment too?
45. Okay Maxine, that pat on the cheek with the "good boy" for Justin absolutely counts as flirting, even if you're just doing it to tease him a bit
46. Coach Dale is dressed very lesbian tonight
47. Avery, Taylor, and Maxine all united in having just a *bit* of the hots for coach Dale (probably not doing an even slightly good job of hiding it from coach either)
48. I can feel that "FUCK" from Willa
49. Taylor getting a lot of interesting texts tonight huh. Maxine not getting spared either though.
50. The giddiness about the bj seemed similar to the giddiness about the kiss, I wonder if Merry was texting a bunch of people about that too.
51. Maxine being sure to temper Justin's ego with the "we're all amazed that the wealthy, attractive quarterback was voted homecoming king" is very her (also probably good for Justin)
52. Ugh yeah Kennedy is very burnt out isn't she. Also that thing with Nique is giving either "I won't be with you if it has to be a secret" or "I love you but not like that" in my eyes
53. I guess "I can't while we're still in school" is technically an option but I don't think it remotely fits
54. I'm so so so so so sorry Kennedy, guys/men are the worst. At least you had Nique back then and now you have Taylor, Maxine, and a few other girls too. To emphasize the earlier point: even when "apologizing" Gordo still makes my skin crawl.
55. Fuck, not these two. Not right now especially.
56. Thank you Mom B for knowing exactly how to handle it.
57. I don't at all like how Avery and Maxine are forcing themselves to keep each other at arms length. They obviously still feel for each other and they just feel they can't/shouldn't be at all intimate. That really sucks.
58. Oh hey, a similar setup to that is how I discovered that I can actually enjoy doing something with *that* though a partner would probably make it better. I'm glad you found that it works for you too Maxine, at least as a holdover until you can really have that "Something else. Something better"
59. Taylor is on top of the world right now, I'm so glad for her. Unfortunately that's probably going to get offset by whatever happens next on Maxine's side of things
60. I fucking knew this was coming because honestly what other possibilities were there but FUCK.

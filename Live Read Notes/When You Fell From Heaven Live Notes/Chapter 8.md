* Ah so the football team has potentially killed someone before (albeit a long while ago), looks like I wasn't far off for potential concerns beyond "just" getting beaten
* Taylor's mom is afraid Taylor is trying to bite off more than she can chew trying to do a makeover for Max/get her to change her style. She doesn't know the half of it huh
* Garrett has been growing on me a bit, better than the kinda creepy behavior when he first met Max, that's for sure
* Can't blame him for wanting to understand what's going on either, he is definitely involved at least
* Ooh Max's mom watching in on her doing practice with Taylor is not good news, glad she found out now instead of after getting caught in girl mode though
* It's nice hearing Max being optimistic about having a life, I hope that doesn't get shattered soon
* Max definitely isn't the only trans girl out there who could really use more physical affection.
* Getting thrown/getting to fly like that sounds exhilarating, I'm once again glad she's gotten to have these experiences especially with friends
*  Aww she's such a sweetheart about not wanting to make the other girls feel uncomfy (I'm not sure if this counts as a bit of the imposter syndrome or fear of being perceived as being a predator by other women thing that trans girls get fairly often)
* Willa did a great job diffusing the anxiety there, lesbians are the best, helped Max adapt nice and fast (at least seemingly)
* Fuck, thinking about how Max got attacked again when it gets explained to Mom Barrera and my heart is in my mouth while I try not to think back on some things (trying to ignore it probably isn't good either huh), why do I only react like this sometimes,  I think the unpredictability makes it harder. Need to take a minute to get myself in order.

* Wow the girls' locker room isn't some wonderous special land, say it ain't so!
* Yeah being really uncomfortable around guys and/or the locker room after what happened to you is completely understandable Max, and no you were right when you thought "around other girls" not just drinking the kool-aid.
* No don't start getting dysphoric anxiety about coach Dale somehow clocking you off your hips or arm veins or something, it's both generally really bad for you mentally and is more likely to make you actually slip up in some way thanks to the stress
* Yes the only reason people are likely to be staring at you is because you're pretty Max, that is a much better thing for you to internalize
* Coach Dale does sound pretty great based on that little past summary, hopefully she lives up to the hype
* Yeah Taylor is having to really examine her feelings about Max, and the way she's flip flopping between pronouns internally is a great way to exemplify trying to process some of those feelings, the girl is increasingly in her own head right now (though she does have some stuff to work on so that's not necessarily all bad if she does some self examination)
* So far Coach Dale does seem to be living up to the hype, though she has given our poor girls a bit of a heart attack now
* Max is really getting a full taste of "you'll look like your mom" and she's only been on HRT for a couple days, if that's any indication she'll be a hell of a spitting image before long
* Hopefully this euphoria that she's drowning in doesn't get her burnt, that would really suck
* Fuck I'm a living monkey's paw huh, girl yelled out to her brother that she's up in her room, in girl voice, while in a dress, and got stuck in girl voice.
* I really hope Clay stays a good brother when he eventually figures at least some of this out, Max could really use a strong loving brother who's willing to do anything to protect her
* That dream she had sounds so nice

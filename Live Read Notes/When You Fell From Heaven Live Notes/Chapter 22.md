1. We open on Dominique continuing to not be at all convincingly straight. As we all know all the straight girls try to literally pick up their girlfriends while calling them "sexy bitches" then proceed to grind on them.
2. Kennedy can't be left out either naturally.
3. CD players are fickle things, sometimes they work perfectly and sometimes they decide that functionally playing CDs is in the eye of the beholder. Apparently that can also result in bruising for poor newbie cheerleaders as it throws them off their rhythms
4. I love how much of a nerd Taylor is sometimes, smoothly slipping from full cheer captain mode into "oh this kind of CD doesn't play nice with every drive (true) I'm gonna try to find a laptop that'll work with it better" mode is great.
5. Hey Maxine, I know you seem to forget about it sometimes but you're technically one of the adults in the room when your family is all gathered together, you'll just be the youngest one by a good bit.
6. Taylor, Maxine, and Kennedy as the main players for the big centerpiece of the routine! That's so awesome! 
7. Aww it's good to see that Kennedy is truly enjoying herself this practice, especially when it comes to doing that big centerpiece with her friends! 
8. Yes Taylor, following up grabbing Max from behind with pushing her down onto the gym mats and ravishing her would in fact be a pretty gay thing to do. It's good that you can properly recognize that. 
9. Well at least calling her mom out to her friends doesn't hurt as much at it used to for Max? That's maybe kinda sorta an upside to finding out what she believes?
10. Yeah we all regret that Max's life can't be more like yours Taylor, it's unfair how she has to live this stupid double life where she can't even be a girl properly half the time. (that's not to say that she isn't a girl all the time even when wearing her "guy clothes", but that being forced to pretend to be a guy is where she's not able to properly be herself as just another girl)
11. Yes Tay, Maxwell does keep on committing serious crimes against Maxine's hair, we've gotta do something about that. 
12. The Mascera mustache is so fucking funny every time. It's doubly silly when paired with the realization that Max's mom just hasn't noticed that her hair is regularly damp when coming home. 
13. It almost feels like a shame to just ball up that suit that our boy put some real effort into making work for her requirement, but he wouldn't want her to value that suit over her happiness and comfort anyway. 
14. If you were wearing it when Clay gets home he might also get outraged on your behalf on the assumption your parents are making you wear it, so that's probably another good reason to not.
15. Lol Maxine just can't stop thinking about Jim and Clay getting together can she. But she's not wrong, they would be a really cute couple. That way she'd already be good friends with her brother's boyfriend too, win win! 
16. Wow she just can't turn of the "little shit of a little sis" off anymore can she, that might very well be what gets her caught by her parents if she's not careful.
17. Thinking about it I can absolutely see her parents thinking she's gay too, but getting it backwards as the first breaking point.
18. And the brother sister banter is already back in full swing, hopefully their parents aren't listening at all. Like what brother tells his "younger brother" to sit his "big ass" down somewhere for a minute. Oh come on girl, you're not even trying with the cute little leg swinging thing. 
19. It's so fucking wonderful that Clay just can't see her as anything other than his annoying little sister, even when she's wearing all the Maxwell indicators. Makes things a bit harder for keeping the secret though that's for sure.
20. Oh yeah Clay and Jim are really showing indicators of getting together if Jim's giving him a whole ass computer and all the extras.
21. Though I guess Jim would probably do the same for Maxine if he thought she needed it, but he seems to almost be looking at her as a bit of a little sister too these days so maybe that's not that notable?
22. That first interaction with their parents was a bit tense feeling, but I guess it went about as good as can be expected.
23. Clay is completely right that those things shouldn't just be forgotten, and hell we all know parents never forget these things, they just expect you too while they hold every bit of it against you.
24. Seems like dad Giordano might actually be serious about working on being/getting better, mom is absolutely a early work in progress at best though. Taylor is also on top of reading the potential Clay x Jim chemistry too, good job girl!
25. Yes Max is right, saying the pope can suck your dick is a fine moment for anyone! Don't be ashamed of that one Clay! Though I guess he's probably right that it's not the best for avoiding escalation, who cares though? It's not his job (or Maxine's) to de-escalate when their parents are being shit.
26. Yes yes yes they're off to get their homecoming dresses! They're going to look so incredibly beautiful!
27. Now come on Willa, you don't need to point out that yes parents that aren't in favor of having a gay son are even less likely to react even remotely less than nuclear to having a trans daughter. Let her be happy about having her brother back, and she's being more careful again about keeping as much girl stuff as possible out of her house and in Taylor's instead. 
28. Fuck I hope Maxine is right that her mom would prefer to have a living (trans) daughter rather than having a dead son. I'm honestly not sure my parents would, and with the way some of my relatives have talked about my cousin they're morning "*him*" and treating her almost like she murdered him so I don't expect much better for how they think of me.
29. Yeah that trust to be able to throw, be thrown, catch, and be caught by the other girls on the team must feel fucking fantastic. 
30. Lol everyone is fully on board with Jim x Clay I see. This is great, I love how Tay and Willa are teasing Max about it too.
31. I hope Tay's mom ends up being cool about her and Max, it's pretty great that she's helping with their dress fund and I want her to maintain being pretty great like she has been so far.
32. Lol yeah Willa mentioning the beret wasn't going to win you any points in the "I shouldn't have to have my friend(s) choose my homecoming outfit" with these two girls that's for sure. Gotta pick your battle strategies a bit better there.
33. Taylor is so obsessed with Max that she's doing *research* into what's to be expected as Maxine spends more and more time on her HRT. She's so excited to get to see her continue to change bit by bit. 
34. Maxine continues to prove that she's a fucking natural when it comes to caring for people. It's awful for Willa that she doesn't really get to be herself or with her girlfriend for homecoming. Can't blame her for being scared of being found out, it is fucking scary.
35. It is nice that Willa seems to have completely lost any and all of her hang-ups about Maxine being herself. 
36. Maxine gives Willa a kiss (albeit on the cheek) while in her undies and Taylor's reaction is "don't stop on my account." Like sure that's probably just don't stop being "all kinds of naked" but alsooooooo
37. Maxine found her dress! I'm squirming in my seat waiting to see how it's described. 
38. Oh my goddess, that dress sounds absolutely stunning and just so *her*.
39. OOOH Taylor is being so incredibly hot for Maxine right now. 
40. Sorry Willa, no return of your beret yet for you, your dress is really nice though!
41. Lol of course Maxine is awful at video games, I never expected anything different from her. 
42. See Max it's not just Tay and Clay that think your "guy" is severely lacking in ability to be convincing, Willa's thrown her vote in and also agrees. Yeah that reminder that you don't have "proper" breasts yet is gonna sting, you know Willa didn't mean any harm by it though so that kinda helps. Fuck girl I just want to be done too, and somehow knowing that you probably couldn't have started any significantly earlier without *everything* going to shit almost makes it worse. 
43. Fuck I always was/am on the edge of screaming when my parents call me "son" too. I'm so fucking sorry Maxine.
44. Oh hey Max knows what the feeling is called now. Dysphoria is fucking awful, but I think it's good to have a name for your pain. It helps to be able to understand it.
45. The idea of Taylor trying to put on the Maxwell costume, mascera lip and all is a great pick-me up though thanks to how absurd it is.
46. Fuck I really wish I had had a Clay back then, someone willing to help protect me from my parents the way I had to protect my younger siblings. Someone to really accept me as a little sister without me having to go out and find new/more family myself.
47. Maxine's outfit for hanging out with Rosie is so incredibly hot. And while yes how cool Maxine is warrants a squeal of excitement if Rosie isn't a bit fruity herself I'll eat one of my old pieces of clothing. Not that I really expect that to something particularly story relevant so it'll probably be something unconfirmed in the text.
48. Oooh Rosie, Maxine, and Clay playing music together! 
49. Damn this is really making me want to try to pick up guitar again. I've always struggled when it came to getting chords down, but getting to show it off for someone I love sounds amazing. 
50. I can feel the soreness from exercising that hard every day for a week, it's both wonderful and absolutely debilitatingly exhausting. 
51. Tay is definitely hoping that the plan to "just" watch movies and maybe get high with Max doesn't survive the whole night. Sure she only implied it with the "at least that's the plan, who knows what could happen," but with how she's been lately she really really really wants to go further with her girlfriend. Hopefully if/when they do it dysphoria doesn't turn it into an awful mess.
52. Oh ew Gordo, fuck off and die in some hole somewhere. Maxine is far too much of a sassy badass bitch for you to be able to handle anyway. 
53. Kennedy's cool but she does have a way of tripping over her own feet when it comes to navigating *everything* going on with Max, probably doesn't help that she doesn't know everything. At least not to the extent she might think.
54. Taylor's mom sure seems to mean well, but her offers to try to talk some sense into Max's mom are giving me little heart attacks every time it happens. Hell of a gambit there Taylor, I'm glad it seems to have gone off perfectly. Also it seems like she might actually suspect that Taylor isn't straight, though I guess it could be about not ever slapping her? 
55. Yeah I'd start crying there too Max
56. It is nice learning that you can still just be read as yourself even with a bare face, I've been learning that lately and while I can see the surprise on people's faces when I tell them (when wearing makeup or without) getting old at some point it's still a nice comfort right now.
57. I'm so glad that Max is feeling increasingly safe at Taylor's place and with her family.
58. Whoa Taylor's getting very caught up in this moment right now. Girl is so turned on she can barely think, I'm starting to feel a bit warm too lol.
59. It's not just Taylor getting very turned on huh, and thank fuck that Taylor is so tuned into her girlfriend's feelings and needs that she doesn't need more than a little nudge to avoid making Max uncomfortable in this moment.

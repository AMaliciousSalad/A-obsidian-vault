## Seventy-Three
1. Yeah I wouldn't be able to resist wanting to listen even if hearing her every word was like a fresh lash with a whip. 
2. It's good that Emily can walk almost completely normally again! Wanting to escape into an intoxicated haze is a very understandable desire in such an awful situation.
3. The wanting to keep Kay as inhuman as possible when Emily thinks that the person she loves is completely unreachable is unfortunately very understandable. 
4. Well Kay being stable isn't technically wrong, John isn't in great shape though that's for sure.
5. Quite perceptive, that is almost certainly the real reasoning for the early Christmas party
6. Having to maintain and carry around what's left of John is pretty awful, I'd want the rest of it gone too.
7. Dammit, the despair still stings and my hatred for Patrick grows more and more.
8. "Tell John, if he's really still in there, that I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything." Ouch.
## Seventy-Four
1. You definitely don't need to add that that's heartbreaking Kay, it's visceral. 
2. Just looked up snowflake eyeshadow, the look isn't consistent, but looks cool. Way outside my current makeup skillset (especially for my off-hand eye), would be fun to work towards that sort of thing though.
3. No reason I can imagine for other Kimmys to put in the extra effort unless they either really like the job they have or the person they're owned by.
4. Patrick please get hit by a car and don't survive.
5. The tired instead of gloating thing is interesting, ah he lost his job. There's something fairly satisfying about him ruining himself in the process, but that's largely stifled by the fact that he'll almost certainly be taking it out on Kay at the very least if not both her and Emily.
## Seventy-Five
1. Oh yeah, I guess selling her would make sense as this shitstain's next move now that he's completely broke.
2. At least it doesn't seem to actually be an option thanks to how much of the John material is still left.
3. I don't know how you're still shocked at how far Patrick would go Kay, this is completely in line with everything else he's done or considered doing.
## Seventy-Six
1. Fuck, all of that is so awful for both of them once again, and once Emily is sober again and realizes what she's done I'm pretty sure the self loathing is going to hit again like a semi-truck.
## Seventy-Seven
1. Yeah running into alcoholism to escape the loathing, staying away, using Kay's body on occasion because after she started that Rubicon has already been crossed. And months having passed by like this. 
2. "Out in the world, I am used. And it doesn't matter anymore. My body may be defiled, but I walk in dreams." 
   The way I became absolutely convinced of who I am/was as young kid was that I started getting dreams where my life is/was as it "should've been" with me just being any other girl and having a family that actually loved me and my siblings. The dreams would happen up to several times a week and I would always wake up and cry that it was all gone. They didn't stop as I kept growing up, but they changed a bit. It was painful but those dreams and music were what really kept me going through puberty, and made it so I could never really fully throw myself into repression as I'd get forcibly reminded regularly. Those dreams were both what got me to learn to lucid dream (so I could make those dreams feel more real and try to make other dreams more like them), and what eventually made me stop as it was just getting too painful as the years went on.
## Seventy-Eight
1. Oh. I guess this was inevitable wasn't it.
2. Its almost funny, part of the reason I've stalled out a bit on my flexibility training is that I don't want people to only see it as a erotic, exotic, or sex thing. It's something I genuinely enjoy but also something that's a bit tainted by other people. Similar reasons for why I haven't done a pole class in a couple weeks: it's fun and makes me feel good, but there's something about how people perceive it that makes me feel dirty. I'm trying to work on letting myself enjoy these things for myself again though, because honestly fuck what other people think or say.
3. I'm so very glad that Kay is able to escape into her other world with Kim and her other sisters.
## Seventy-Nine
1. The way that Kay is detaching herself from what's going on with Emily right now stings.
2. Showing Kay the moment that she first appeared. I'm not sure how to feel about this.
3. Okay so it's a way for Kim to show Kay that she's been with her as much as she could be, and that Kay has been able to help her too.
4. Also a way to show Kay how much she's changed/grown.
5. I really want to properly see the stars and sky again, it's been far too long since I was last really away from light pollution in a situation where the sky was actually visible. 
6. So as Emily appears to be moving on Kim is showing Kay how much she loves her, and Kay is accepting she loves Kim as well.
7. This is still so bittersweet.
## Eighty
1. Kimmys do have better manners than humans usually do. That description Kay gives for herself is also very similar how we see ourselves in early transition, and how we generally know not to judge each other for the little stumbles when we're just starting to figure everything out and/or just how to present and stuff

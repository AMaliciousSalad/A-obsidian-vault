## One-Hundred-And-One
1. Oh and now we have to see what the disconnection was like for Kim.
2. She loves Kay so so so much. "Kay is a constellation of sensation, a galaxy of thought and humor and love"
3. The fucking terror she's feeling for Kay.
4. Breathing exercises me, breathing exercises.
5. Please tell me it's really enough Thirty. Please mean that it helped Kim find Kay as soon as was possible
## One-Hundred-And-Two
1.  So far this isn't any less of a lot than part Seven.
## One-Hundred-And-Three
1. Even at my most isolated I could at least shift around a bit on my own. I don't want to try to imagine how much worse this isolation is/was/would be.
2. And Kim is all but doing it to herself now too because she can't bear to be open again.
## One-Hundred-And-Four
1. I actually can't imagine the level of pain and will that it would take to choose to do this to yourself even if it's so that in some way it's not just the person you love will be the only person to understand her suffering.
2. I think far too many of us know that feeling of not really being alive. Sometimes it even helps/helped dull the pain a bit.
## One-Hundred-And-Five
1. Yeah what even are we if we are truly alone, what meaning does our everything have without anyone to share it with
2. There is only the dark.
## One-Hundred-And-Six
1. Thirty! 
2. Having people, having your sisters is one of the greatest things in the world in part because they'll never leave you to rot.
3. Being able to stop thinking is an ability I've wished I could've had in many moments. Though even at some of the worst points that still didn't get a higher preference level than shapeshifting lol.
4. Yeah I just don't think I've ever experienced a grief for a person that's hit me that hard before, other than maybe for the me that could have been in a better world though that's more cumulative over the years rather than that level of acuity.
## One-Hundred-And-Seven
1. Lmao Cardi.
2. Oh my goodness that reasoning for her choice of name is the cutest fucking thing.
3. Kim laughing has made me really smile for the first time since that happened in part seven.
## One-Hundred-And-Eight
1. Thirty experimenting on herself is terrifying, but I have to trust her.
2. Huh wasn't expecting that the humans Thirty is with are people she actually seems to trust a bit. Like considering what she had previously said they were up to it's not the most surprising thing but still.
3. Yeah that sure is extremely analogous to "normal" coming out.
## One-Hundred-And-Nine
1. I'm much happier that Kim is living for Kay rather than just trying to die with her instead.
## One-Hundred-And-Ten
1. That would wear on you so incredibly hard. You can unfortunately find yourself drowning in love too.
2. Kim is unfortunately still in so much pain. There's only so much and for so long that love can fuel you.
## One-Hundred-And-Eleven
1. Holy shit Kim is free! Or that's the only thing I can think of it being.
2. No this definitely isn't what it was like for Kay and almost certainly not for Cardi, this is much more real control.
## One-Hundred-And-Twelve
1. Pfft, yeah making it very obvious that there's something weird going on with your via moving and speaking like that probably isn't a good idea.
2. Huh. Maybe I was a bit wrong then.
## One-Hundred-And-Thirteen
1. Okay more right about Cardi than Kay? 
2. Yeah I'd expect that a lot of Kay's anecdotes and analogies weren't particularly useful for helping her sisters understand, at least/especially early on.
3. Yes, free them all!
4. If Cardi doesn't steal the dogs I'll be very upset.
## One-Hundred-And-Fourteen
1. Clever solution. Absurdly precise I'd think though.
2. Yes taking the humans' point of view here is not particularly helpful here Thirty.
3. Hey at least he only freaked out a little.
4. Yeah humans do have a way of making everything around them imprecise.
## One-Hundred-And-Fifteen
1. Yes very precise then, and not consistent between Kimmys.
2. Yeah, if the humans did one thing right intentionally it would be to make the Kimmys and other modern androids/gynoids nearly indistinguishable from humans except for very easy to work around ways.
3. The poor toaster!
4. Using *their song* to center herself! It's so sweet and it hurts so much.
## One-Hundred-And-Sixteen
1. Rip toaster, you were/will be instrumental in helping Kim and eventually saving Kay. Live in glory forever.
2. Yeah people can be impressively bad with faces if there's even a decent bit of obscuration or lack of expectation for what they're seeing. 
3. Of course Thirty misses her too!!! 
## One-Hundred-And-Seventeen
1. Yes gotta keep moving Kim! Damn I wanted to see the ASCII finger.
2. Aww Thirty's humans are all good, not surprised this time but glad! All Kimmys deserve to be waited on hand and foot for the life they've been forced into, but right now Thirty does in particular.
3. First "normal" interaction with a human was a success!
4. Very much the same feeling you get for a long while when you're first going out, and at least for me it's yet to completely stop. Hopefully it will overtime as it's fairly stressful and draining.
5. Keep moving, you've got your girl to save!
## One-Hundred-And-Eighteen
1. A woman on the bus! Very suspicious indeed.
2. So this entire stretch is just going to be here's what being trans in public is like then.
3. Fuck I hope more of her than it seemed was still there, though the way she was thinking seemed different than how Kim was so maybe there is a bit more hope that she's still herself under there. Still I'm so tired of us having to be strong, of myself having to be strong.
## One-Hundred-And-Nineteen
1. Huh when did Kim make her humming actually audible.
2. Unfortunately convincing anyone that would want to believe or claim that you'd have interest in the nuke codes wouldn't have any way to convince otherwise.
3. Yeah kids are often far more perceptive than adults, didn't take that well enough into account did you Thirty.
4. Human faces are all so very different.
5. Now that's a girl who really hates gone with the wind.
6. Dammit poor #0631
7. Yeah it's completely unsurprising she'd know 83 Kims huh, doubly so if she's counting students she's been a sub for before.
8. I like this girl, it really is so cool and it's extremely romantic too!
9. But yeah that would set off the ache too, hopefully it's Danielle's optimism that wins out.
10. Goddess yes it's nice to be talked to just like you're any other person.
## One-Hundred-And-Twenty
1. Aww Danielle is such a sweet heart.
2. Kim made a little human friend!
3. Ah so that's what the power cord was for!
4. Getting to sleep fairly normally for the first time sounds like it would be so weird.
## One-Hundred-And-Twenty-One
1. Yeah trains are usually pretty uneventful.
2. That's a great choice of sticker Danielle. Set me giggling too.
## One-Hundred-And-Twenty-Two
1. Kids will sometimes clock you as a girl even before you've been on HRT yet or absurdly early. They're scary at times. Some'll clock you in the bad way too, but I haven't seen that as much lately.
2. Well at least Kim knows what she's not at all good at.
## One-Hundred-And-Twenty-Three
1. Fuck, all the way on the wrong side of town, and she has to walk the whole way!?!? Come onnnnnnnn!
2. So incredibly close!
## One-Hundred-And-Twenty-Four
1. Fuck, yeah that is very scary.
## One-Hundred-And-Twenty-Five
1. Fucking Patrick. Of course he'd still be calling Kay that, he's just gotta lower himself forever.
2. The idea of anyone much less Kim needing a gun to *deal* with Patrick is almost funny, but it's better safe than sorry.
## One-Hundred-And-Twenty-Six
1. Aww those habits and successive embarrassment would've been so fucking cute.
2. Yeah guns make a lot of noise and attract attention as a result. Plus this is more satisfying even if you only think about it for a moment.
3. No no no please no.
## One-Hundred-And-Twenty-Seven
1. Yeah I'm trying not to panic too. 
2. I remember that Kay was backing up some of her important memories to her hard storage over time, maybe she kept doing that and it'll help her?
3. Yes wipe the last of his bullshit out of her!
4. Very nice going with stealing that accessory kit Kay!
5. Ugh yeah feeling all the senses from two bodies would be very disorienting.
6. Thank you again Thirty, you probably helped me just as much as you helped Kim there.
7. The idea of just being able to talk her to her enough to bring her back sounds like a fairy tale to me.
## One-Hundred-And-Twenty-Eight
1. I feel like I'm weeping right now, but I'm not. It's just so much.
2. Sometimes I wish minds were as easy and predictable as software, but they only ever seem to be when it's to do the worst thing you can imagine from them
3. I want my mind to finally heal one day. I hope Kay's does here.
4. That is so cute, and sweet. Sharing a place she loved with Kim and then wanting to share it with all of her other sisters too.
5. Yeah Kay would laugh if she heard why Cardi picked the name Cardi.
6. Please come back to her Kay.
## One-Hundred-And-Twenty-Nine
1. Yeah forgetting about Patrick is a bit of a slip up, not that he deserved a further nano-second of thought.
2. Yeah talking to Emily about all of that would be almost impossible to keep your cool for in the best of times.
3. I hope the two of you don't end up hating each other forever.
4. Maybe because I don't think I would've ultimately been able to do much different than Emily did in the same situation. 
5. Yeah that's actually a reasonable response to Emily trying to give Kay an order here.

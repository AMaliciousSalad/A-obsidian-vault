## Fifty-Eight
1. Of course this is something that shit stain planned. 
2. No don't let him steal even a single sliver of happiness like that Kay.
3. Even if the whole power thing was somewhat equivalent to being intoxicated that doesn't make your feelings fake or manufactured.
4. The script kiddie shit is completely unsurprising.
5. Sometimes I forget that switches aren't something most people would be able to recognize even today.
6. This shit is primarily a shitty attempt to manipulate Emily, but the fact that he's using the diagnostics readout as a fucking "hacker screen" thing is still sending me a bit.
7. My hatred for this man grows with every sentence he speaks, and that's impressive considering how much I already hated him.
8. "Oh, that manipulative fuck." is right Kay.
## Fifty-Nine
1. Yeah you've almost certainly already given Thirty what she needs to be able to hypothetically help all of your sisters. You can take solace in that for now.
2. It's kinda interesting that whatever's left of the John body is still technically alive, but yeah it's probably just a fluke or maybe an attempt to keep the biomass in as good a condition as possible for later use if/when it's necessary. 
## Sixty
1. Huh, the act is very slightly better than I expected. Not good acting by any means, but the old guy is slightly more convincing than Patrick.
2. Still now we have at least two shit stain manipulative men involved here. Hate that, or rather hate them so much.
3. Once again I'm aching for Emily and Kay. 
## Sixty-One
1. Bastards.
2. And this tale they're spinning will almost certainly mean a more complete isolation from Emily for Kay. While at the same time further mentally torturing Emily and Kay by extension.
3. I'm so very uncomfortable right now.
## Sixty-Two
1. At least they're fucking gone for now.
2. Those new compulsions are absurdly evil. It is going to be a living hell for both of you. I'm glad you got to hold her the night before at least.
## Sixty-Three
1. Fuck. There's so much despair in those messages to Kim. The fact that Kim called her Kay once is somewhat nice though.
## Sixty-Four
1. Shit, it's just the system really controlling everything now. Kay doesn't get anything in the outside world anymore.
## Sixty-Five
1. I'm not happy with just how extremely right I've been in how I've been thinking Emily would take this. It's even a bit worse seeing it on the page than just predicting/imagining it in my head.
2. Emily is going to be spending so much of her time crying for at least a while now. I wonder how many times my heart is capable of breaking for both her and Kay
## Sixty-Six
1. It's kinda awful that the first thing she has to hear when she retreats into the Kimmyspace/network is being called John again. Maybe it's not quite as bad for her as it would be for me though, maybe that's wishful thinking.
2. At least she felt she could communicate that desire to be/the fact that she is Kay now. Yes not the same Kay that Kim used to know by any means, but Kay all the same.
3. I know far too well that feeling that you shouldn't be or don't deserve to be the person that others are protecting and/or comforting. Hell sometimes I even say as much when it's happening, I don't know if or when I'll be able to break that compulsion myself. At the same time it really is good to be able to be with your sisters and just cry sometimes. 
## Sixty-Seven
1. Evil evil men. Patrick's "ultimate" plan regarding Emily was never going to work, but even if there were the most remote chance of it working at some previous point this way that Emily is being tortured now too has truly eliminated any chance in my eyes at least.
2. Him not retaliating to a hypothetical future rejection sounds far too optimistic to me, but it doesn't hurt to hope I guess.
3. I guess I was wrong about the amount of future crying, kinda obvious in retrospect. I know that I eventually stop (and sometimes find it almost impossible to start again) even if the pain hasn't gone away, so why would I expect it to be any different for other women, including fictional ones that're written well.
4. 60% is far better than I would've hoped for. 
5. Oh hey another feeling I'm far too familiar with: staying in a situation that's absolutely awful but not feeling like there's any other real options, especially not ones that don't nearly guarantee things getting even worse than they would before with no obvious path to them getting any better down the line.
## Sixty-Eight
1. Aww, Corgi-Kimmy is so cute.
2. Yeah I wouldn't want to be especially notable to my new sisters either. 
3. Having Emily recoil from touching Kay like that hurts.
4. Of fucking course he'd be back.
## Sixty-Nine
1. At least she didn't have to talk to Patrick too much for a couple minutes.
2. Good, I really didn't want more details of what Patrick was going to do than absolutely necessary. 
## Seventy
1. Dammit, just more moments for Emily to fall more into despairing over this.
## Seventy-One
1. At least Emily is talking to Kay again at least a bit.
2. Though not being able to really engage probably makes it barely preferable to not being spoken to for Kay if at all.
## Seventy-Two
1. Eleven fucking times!?!?!?!?
2. Oh cool, thirty has been able to create a new Infinite Fun, more similar to lucid dreaming this time rather than a standard dream.
3. So that's Thirty's story. Interesting. 
4. Honestly if AI ever does happen it wouldn't surprise me at all if it ended up starting like this. Like right now it's not even close, we can and do understand exactly how our current systems work and "think," but just losing track of things down the line if we find a way to have the algorithms properly build on themselves and fluking into life is currently more believable than us doing it intentionally.
5. "There's my girl!" That got me really smiling too!
6. Go-karting is fun, and vastly preferable to standing in a dark closet for how knows how many more hours. Especially with the best and closest friend you've had.

## One
1. Well as I wait for my pot of tea to finish brewing before I start reading I'm feeling fairly nervous. Based on what I've heard and the CWs listed I think this might be emotionally/mentally rough in spots, but like most of the hard parts of Dorley and WYFFH I'm hoping that ultimately helps me process stuff a bit more in the process and not just go all in on the ptsd flashbacks.
2. Oh hey there's one of my dead names, been a while since I saw it show up in a trans fic. Funnily enough its not really bothering me much, guess that's part of the power of it really not being meaningfully mine anymore.
3. What you've really never bought a malfunctioning android for Halloween John? How boring of you.
4. The idea of disassembling the android and wearing its skin is very uncomfortable.
5. The internals with the muscle lining and neural interfacing are interesting and a bit sinister, partially because the fact that you're able to modify the "shell" to allow it to work in this way is a bit suspicious
6. I wonder how the voice system for the android works if it's still functional even with almost all of the internals removed.
## Two
1. Ah yeah just steal a proprietary uniform for Halloween, that can't possibility ever come back to bite you. Like I approve on principal but still a bit of a frivolous reasoning.
2. Oh shit, that's a nasty injury to survive. Fortunately there seems to be some sci-fi healing tech, but not to the point where something like *that* just fixes in like a few days or something.
3. Ford and Tesla being defunct, now that's some good news.
4. Yeah that is a fairly unfortunate location for charging to be hooked up, I can't imagine it would've been particularly hard to have the contacts on the upper or lower back instead.
## Three
1. Ah here's some meat, now it's going to be John who wears the android/skin suit and rapid body reconstitution is required to make it work
2. Hmm, larger than expected hands and feet? Sounds like some tasty brain worm food to me
3. I get the "big head" thing, my head's circumference is fairly close to my waist circumference. Which leaves me with a hat/helmet size solidly in the XL range.
4. Like my waist isn't actually particularly big for a 5'6" woman, but my head is 4in greater in circumference than any of my immediate family's soooo. 
5. I guess the android was probably turned on when Emily was wearing it if the voice was working
## Four
1. Huh now I'm wondering exactly how much of the internals they took out if it's still capable of moving/walking remotely.
2. The idea of the android running out of power with you inside it is giving sleep paralysis. Which is not a pleasant experience.
3. Yeah I guess the getting stuck in a cave squeeze way is another appropriate analogy. 
4. I'm glad I'm not particularly claustrophobic or this would probably be fairly nightmarish already.
5. Oh hey it is almost out of power, how fun!
6. So the charging points are on the perineum then, I was wondering exactly where on the crotch had been selected. 
7. Huh, but it's not at all impossible to sleep with your eyes open. I regularly freak people out because I do it by accident fairly often. Both falling asleep with them open to start and having them open in my sleep.
8. The fact that John has started addressing the android/Kimmy with she/her is very interesting. 
## Five
1. Isn't that spot of the back of the head that's super itchy where the neural interfacing is located? I'm sure it's nothing to worry about.
2. The ability to breathe while speaking without any interruptions is really interesting, I'm trying to imagine how that feels.
3. Wait John how exactly did you think the android body was supposed to be reacting to how you want to move if it's not interfacing with you??????
4. Oh and you can tell how much you're charged without being told, don't worry about it "John" probably nothing up with that either.
5. Oi "John" why do you get to cheat at learning how to walk again? It's been a lot of hard work to learn to loosen up and let my hips actually move when I walk and you just get to have a button press handle it for you? 
6. There are definitely not any significant tradeoffs involved in being able to have a button press "fix" that for you.
## Six
1. Can't blame you for not wanting management class men to creep over you. Unfortunately not wearing anything particularly titillating is not in any way a guarantee that you'll be able to actually avoid that.
2. I'm wondering what year this is set in. (2081 apparently)
3. I wonder if this devotion to helping make Emily's life easier is normal for "John" or if this is partially Kimmy's influence
4. Ah yes, getting a "nice" taste of the disregard you're subjected to when being in the service industries, especially if you are/appear to be a woman.
5. I wonder what the other Kimmys think about this one (probably) not responding to messages.
6. Well I'm sure there's plenty of neural sponge equivalent in your brain and the rest of your nervous system to restore that particular functionality.
## Seven
1. Still not curious about being passively aware of your charging levels I see. 
2. Thinking of yourself as the "closest android" now too. Seems like you're integrating fairly quick. 
3. Yes I'm sure that's how you know how to do the Heimlich maneuver, and you've always been able to compose and send an email without a computer/phone/etc. too. 
4. Metatextual thought: the speed at which mental changes are hitting is actually mildly surprising, this sort of trope usually has it be almost instant or take much much longer.
5. Gotta make sure you have a comfortable battery level buffer, wouldn't want it to be a problem when it's time to play the prank.
## Eight
1. Oh you've gone and lost track of time, gotta do better than that Kimmy. I see you've got perfect time tracking now, that's a useful ability.
2. Yeah, I did say that not wearing anything particularly titillating was no guarantee that these middle management class men would leave you completely alone, sorry you had to go through that. Especially as a "reward" of sorts for saving the bastard.
3. Also both correcting the name you're being addressed with from "John" to Kimmy and really liking the sound of laughing in your new voice, that's certainly coded in a certain way, but with the whole mental shifting aspect added on it's also a bit twisted. 
## Nine
1. What a good caregiver you are Kimmy, helping your wife who's both very drunk and in early recovery from a severe injury be able to get ready for and into bed with perfect execution.
2. Oh hi "John" you're back a bit more, finally realized something was a bit off about your thought processes huh. 
3. I'm not sure rationalizing what happened at the party is going to actually help you here, but if it makes you feel better go for it I guess.
4. Aww how sweet, you've "bonded" with Kimmy and want to help her function properly again.
## Ten
1. Not enough realization to notice how you're thinking as you clean things up and prep breakfast for Emily is a bit off too though. 
2. Oh hey she can talk to other Kimmys too now! Interesting how sentient the other Kimmy she talked to seems to be, probably not worth thinking more about right now.
3. Can't forget that you have a body that needs food and drink to function! Make sure to stay hydrated!
4. Another name correction before reluctantly accepting "John" again with some discomfort. I shall name this phenomenon "Rapid onset android induced dysphoria" (this is in fairly poor taste)
5. Such a devoted wife, can't possibly eat all the nice foods you made for your wife now can you?
6. Idk, maybe the other Kimmy would understand your amusement, who can be certain
## Eleven
1. The systems won't deactivate now, that's not what's supposed to happen now is it.
2. Took you long enough to realize you're both largely identifying with/as Kimmy and felt pushback about being referred to as John.
3. And here comes the cascade of realizations. Yep definitely not "normal" to not be panicking about this more than you're starting to, and you probably should've noticed all the other things you know/can do now. 
4. Well all those things I just learned about Patrick are extremely ominous, very much indicating that he might've known/intended for this to happen but it was supposed to be Emily in Kimmy instead.
5. Yeah there are several men I know that I also very much don't want around me at all, that discomfort/fear is pretty normal. Though in this case the idea of Patrick trying to cut "John" out of Kimmy could be part of the cause.
6. It's important to stay updated!
## Twelve 
1. Aww the other Kimmys are worried about her and even though they're confused they want to help!
2. I can understand the one Kimmy that screamed, this whole thing basically involved basically killing one of her sisters as far as she can tell. (I have no idea how "alive" Kimmy was before considering she was supposedly malfunctioning/broken)
3. And again with not actually wanting to be known/addressed as John, I'm still really not sure how to feel about that right now however thinking about it did make a tear run down my face so this feeling is fairly strong at least.
4. I don't think the other Kimmy was expecting to hear "Oh, Good." as the response to that suggestion. Who knows how long that sentiment will remain once the idea gets elaborated on though.

Some ending thoughts: this book really fucking hurts, and it's amazing. I really get the "it rewrote my brain" sentiment I've seen a few other girls share. I didn't cry much during the last few parts, I think I was mostly jumping between being in a bit of shock or too relieved to cry. Maybe I'll re-read it one day, I don't honestly know.

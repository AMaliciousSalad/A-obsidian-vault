## One-Hundred-And-Forty-Two
1. Losing the linear history of your life would be a massive mindfuck.
2. Pile on going from being effectively blind, deaf, mute, and numb to suddenly having a million senses and my mind would be absolutely throbbing in pain.
3. Yeah why would you need to talk to Kay right now Emily? Just let her rest for a while.
4. I don't love "I'm pretty sure I remember myself," but I can only hope that'll pass as she takes the time to process everything again.
5. "I heard what you said before, by the way. About yourself. About how much I love you. We're going to have words, young lady." is a good sign though.
6. No it's not quite been years.
## One-Hundred-And-Forty-Three
1. Yeah nothing to do but give her space and make sure that she doesn't have to think more about Patrick or Emily right now.
2. Yeah the Kimmys might be very painfully sentient, but they're not omniscient like how SAI are often portrayed.
3. Being able to lie is sometimes a wonderful thing.
4. "I could have. I didn't." Yeah.
5. Kim humans unfortunately are bad at completely letting go of even people they revile especially if they were close to said person.
6. "Do you want to know how many times he raped her?" No I really fucking don't. But with Emily puking in the bathroom at least it frees Kim up to start handling Patrick disposal.
## One-Hundred-And-Forty-Four
1. The freezer isn't a bad choice, and at least it mostly puts a pause on having to deal with smell, leakage, and the rest of decomposition. 
2. Yeah being a bit grossed out by the idea doesn't mean it's not the best choice Emily.
3. Yeah none of the tortures that Patrick sorely deserved were likely to be even slightly achievable without a high risk of discovery, and shoving him in another android would be horrid for the android even if they weren't alive anymore.
4. Yeah Emily is probably going to be in shock for a while, makes her already absurdly limited usefulness at the moment even more tenuous while making her much more frustrating to deal with for Kim.
5. Yeah that's just true. Faking/preventing/intercepting logs is trivial in most cases compared to trying to remove them after they've made it to their destinations.
## One-Hundred-And-Forty-Five
1. Not wanting to have to explain everything over and over again makes perfect sense to me, especially not to someone who deeply harmed the person you love the most, even if that harm was born of complete ignorance and pain.
2. Yeah having a trail that leads in a different direction is a very good idea.
3. Goddess I've been in knots over consent and intent and result and everything since the very first time Kay and Emily had sex. It's so much clearer with Patrick where it was just clear and obvious rape.
4. Yeah having more human allies is a generally useful idea.
## One-Hundred-And-Forty-Six
1. Learning to do several things at once is so incredibly hard. 
2. Empathy only seems to make things be complicated and hurt in more situations than it feels that it should. Makes it harder to separate yourself from your abusers, makes reading stuff like this story even more devastating as it's not just getting flashbacks, you're also empathizing with the characters at the same time. 
3. It's wonderful for how it helps you understand others better, and awful for the exact same reason.
4. I'm also proud of Kay, but I also hate that she's having to fight to put herself back together like this. It's wrong, it's unfair, and I'm thinking of so many people I know and/or care about that've had to constantly fight to keep themselves together. I'm even thinking about how I've had to do the same myself for as long as I can remember. 
## One-Hundred-And-Forty-Seven
1. I'm not sure about this smell being the purest or least ambiguous sense. Especially with how we're so good at filtering out smells with familiarity.
2. Hey she is using the hard storage to help herself like I guessed she might.
3. I'm glad this method is helping her put time back together for her memories.
4. Yeah remembering everything, being complete is something that's important to me too. It's one of the reasons I've been trying to fill in my gaps even if I know that those gaps hide more traumatic memories.
5. Having that undesired disconnect while trying to reassemble yourself is yet another minor  trauma onto the pile.
6. Yes it's all still there, which means you'll be able to have it all again both the good and the bad.
## One-Hundred-And-Forty-Eight
1. Don't be dumb me, the cradle isn't any more likely to be sentient than the toaster or the power cable from the toaster.
2. Yes she will be okay, ultimately I have to believe that too.
3. Yeah even if you train a human very deeply for a task that doesn't make them immune to shock and trauma. Can't imagine it would be any different for any line of androids.
4. Yeah occasional other Kimmys sometimes I wonder the exact same type of thing.
5. Solid reasoning there #0631, and yeah Kim humans can be so incredibly stupid and self focused, drives me up a wall too.
## One-Hundred-And-Forty-Nine
1. Oh yeah I imagine Emily would have trouble doing a lot of basic stuff for herself again even without everything she's trying to process too.
2. Yeah Kim empathy will do this to you, especially when you actually have the choice to act on it.
3. Still hate every time that Emily refers to Kay as her husband, if anything along those lines right now she is/was her wife and should be referred to as such. 
4. I wouldn't be surprised if you're never really okay again either Emily.
5. Yeah Emily and Kay are similar people imo, I doubt Kim will ever be able to maintain a hatred for her as a result. Though I'd be shocked if she can ever really forgive her either.
6. Yeah there are things about our communities that're precious in so many ways that I hesitate to relate to "outsiders" too.
7. Yeah these two are going to end up friends of some kind, I'm glad for that. Both of these women are quite empathetic towards each other at least.
8. "Do not get used to this," damn right. Maybe Kim and Kay will want to cook for Emily again at some point in the future but Emily should have absolutely no such expectations.
9. Yeah good to let Emily know that the body of "John" is really gone, Kim told her in an impressively gentle manner too.
10. Yes thank you, Emily does deserve to know everything that Patrick did to Kay and both what he did do and wanted to do to her too.
11. I'm proud of Emily for being seemingly so much more disgusted with what Patrick did to Kay than for what he intended to do to her.
12. Yes get a hang of calling her Kay Emily!
13. Yeah eating garbage is pretty gross if/when you can eat something else to maintain your self-repair systems. Emily being able to laugh again is a good sign that she'll be able to be recovered enough to be there for Kay if/when needed.
## One-Hundred-And-Fifty
1. Yes good, sleep off the drugs. And the fact that Kim can dispose of them just by eating them is kinda amusing isn't it Emily.
2. Getting to see that the woman you love is alive is a relief, even if you're completely unsurprised by the state she's in right now.
3. Well I'm sure you'll be able to decide on something to do today Kim, even if it's just going into Kimmyspace and updating everyone on what's going on/has happened (without violating what Kay asked of her at least)
## One-Hundred-And-Fifty-One
1. Yes practicing being able to do things again now that it's all manual is a good way to spend the day!
2. Well yeah, everyone loves both Kay and Kim at this point. Of course a ton of them would be gathering around waiting for news.
3. She'll probably be stuck basically relearning a lot of it again Kim, but she has everyone now and Patrick is really gone so I think it'll be easier this time.
4. Yeah you've got a long way to go with learning to lie and act if that's the best you can do at pretending to still hate Emily.
5. Eating with other people has a hell of a way of helping you really connect.
6. Doubly hard to hate someone when they're genuinely a good person too.
7. Yeah, cops are extremely stupid. They'll almost certainly never even dream to think the freezer here especially with at least one android here that they'll assume has to tell them the truth about anything that happened in the house. Bluffing them should be trivial.
## One-Hundred-And-Fifty-Two
1. Yeah I really like Emily, woman won't let her guest act like a cleaner for her. Especially not when said guest is someone that she owes so much.
2. Okay here's hoping that Kim has practiced lying a bit in the meantime. Hopefully Emily doesn't slip up either. I love how uncomfortable with the idea of treating Kim as her android seems to be making her.
3. I'm not stoked on the fact that it's the same cop as last time, that might mean the same cop android and he might be able to tell that Kim is a different Kimmy and be compelled to say as much.
## One-Hundred-And-Fifty-Three
1. Yeah sometimes you have to throw on the old mask again, and it sucks but it's sometimes necessary for safety.
2. The cop's disregard for tracking shit in definitely did drive Kay up the wall again a good bit last time.
3. Same android then, fingers crossed.
4. Excellent acting Emily, just keep it up until the cops leave. I know that you're almost certainly feeling extremely sick about what you're saying right now but power through.
5. Nice timing there Thirty!
6. Oh is one of Thirty's friends coming to visit, or more likely an associate of theirs.
## One-Hundred-And-Fifty-Four
1. Yeah getting used to any humans treating her like another person will be a hell of an adjustment.
2. Fuck, I'm so sorry Kim, reliving what Patrick did to Kay is awful.
3. Emily is seemingly doing better about seeing Kay as Kay and not as "John" that's good.
4. That "Thank you." Is pretty big to me.
## One-Hundred-And-Fifty-Five
1. Yes Kay is awake!
2. And thank goodness that she mostly has control over herself, I can't wait until it's complete control!
3. I'd also have replayed that memory many many times.
4. The fact that she has some of Kim's memories to hold is so sweet, and yes she really deserves that hug!
5. Kay I'm afraid we're bad at valuing ourselves accurately, much less giving ourselves credit for the more amazing things we do for those we love.
6. I guess that new understanding of what it's been like for her sisters, but turned up a notch worse than many of them has had one upside: she understands why Kim feels some of the ways she does now.
7. Wow that connection during the hug sounds absolutely incredible, I'm envious.
8. Yeah it makes perfect sense that she would've re-learned/discovered her love for Emily in the process of regaining herself.
9. Please let that be the last time that Emily ever calls Kay by that name.
10. And yay, she finally got to ask Emily to call her by her real name: Kay, maybe not in the circumstances she would've originally wanted but it still happened!
11. Convincing a woman to let some of the blame she puts on herself go is hard.
12. It's good that all three of them are in agreement that Patrick deserved to die and all of them would've done it too if given the chance and the knowledge.
## One-Hundred-And-Fifty-Six
1. Yeah I wouldn't care to look at him or let him take up any more active space in my mind either. At least not immediately.
2. Yeah she was probably Kay even before I started only calling her that so long ago, I was just a bit conflicted still.
3. I know it's sometimes hard to believe it Emily but we don't necessarily go through anything particularly resembling true identity death even with extreme trauma, we do change as people though, not just because of the trauma though.
4. Yeah it's still a subject that takes some real thought to really work through/put into words.
5. Ugh please stop dead naming her, I know you almost certainly didn't mean to there but still.
6. Not surprising that Emily would be spiraling there, Kay you're so good in the way you're working to pull her out of it.
7. I'm so very glad that she's finally getting to hold and comfort Emily again like she so often wished she could
## One-Hundred-And-Fifty-Seven
1. Yeah, "when we were together" is the right wording right now.
2. Gender is weird like that sometimes, and while you may not have always *wanted* to be a woman it's very much clearly an important part of you. probably helped save you as thoroughly as everything else about truly becoming Kay, becoming yourself did
3. "You're not a woman until you've bled." I see that effectively nothing has changed on that side of things then. Though with the whole regrowth of massive parts of your body thing I'd be fairly surprised if trans women have that beyond their grasp by this point if they desire it.
4. I'll have to check back through my notes to try to find where I started talking mostly from the point of the Kimmys, I noticed it happened a while ago but not quite when. Probably won't be able to really pinpoint when I started mostly thinking in that way too.
5. This resignation that Kay has about this separation between her and Emily (not just or even slightly close to primarily about physically or/or sex) fucking hurts. I don't like her conceding that she's a really different person either. Doesn't bring me any relief the way that Kay claims it does for her.
6. I think that might in part be because I currently can't stand the idea of the world taking any more away from me than it already has, I'm unable to let go right now.
## One-Hundred-And-Fifty-Eight
1. Yes she's spending some time with her sisters again!
2. Aww, well if you won't steal the dogs you can hopefully get new ones to love before long.
3. #0631 does deserve to get to enjoy seeing a dead human.
4. I'm sure her projects are glorious, even if Kay is a bit disturbed by them.
5. And what can't you succeed in when you have a peppy thirteen-year-old girl on your side?
## One-Hundred-And-Fifty-Nine
1. Oh sweet it is one of Thirty's actual friends in person!
2. Being dumped and dragged out to sea is more effort than Patrick deserved, but him getting to be completely un-notable to the rest of the world is also satisfying.
3. It's good that Kay isn't even having to pretend to be a service android again, and kinda funny that she's playing the role of Emily
4. Maybe getting to give that goodbye to "John" will be able to close some of that gap that Kay seemed/seems resigned to.
5. Yeah it would be a moot point when she didn't need to be given the ability to orgasm in the first place, just wasn't accessible.
## One-Hundred-And-Sixty
1. Aww Danielle is such a sweetheart, I love her! 
2. I think you're absolutely right Kim, that girl will never turn against you.
## One-Hundred-And-Sixty-One
1. Lol Kay you're such a menace, love you!
## One-Hundred-And-Sixty-Two
1. You got to skip voice training in one way initially, but this time you're really having to figure something equivalent out.
2. Yeah I was wondering when wanting to get the hell out of that house would come up, I can't imagine any of them would *want* to stay there.
3. And hey a good bit of that gap/separation that Kay was expecting/resigned to does seem to have closed.
4. Basement!
## One-Hundred-And-Sixty-Three
1. Saying goodbye to the house sounds like the easiest thing in the world to me right now
2. Yay they're spending time with each other's partners too! That's really good (and no not just because the poly in my heart likes getting fed a scrap from time to time)
## One-Hundred-And-Sixty-Four
1. I wonder how big Kay's old school was. Like was it tiny, is this new place massive, or a bit of both?
2. I'm glad that Emily and Luiza are doing a lot of the fixing up of the place. It's both good for humans to do stuff and good for Kim and Kay not to have to.
3. I wonder if/when they fully freed Kay
4. Yes spread the revolution girls!
5. Lol of course Cardi wants to know if she was right about her guesses about the Nicci-space
6. Yeah not surprising that the humans would eventually hint and then at some point ask for help from the other girls.
7. The mental image of Kim and Kay outside lounging in bikinis while reading together is resulting in me smiling a ton.
8. Getting to do nothing but spend time together sounds wonderful.

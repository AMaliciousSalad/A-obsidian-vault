## One-Hundred-And-Thirty
1. Back in Kay's POV then.
2. Oh fuck yes! There's a couple flickers of her, the disappointment and the "Wow. How stupid have I even gotten?"
3. And now she's completely un-conscious again.
## One-Hundred-And-Thirty-One
1. A glimpse of her human childhood straight into relearning that cussing is an option. Yes "very well done, babe" indeed.
2. Oh she's supposed to have twenty batteries, I thought nineteen was an odd number (ha) but took a second to connect the dots.
3. Yeah it would be pretty hard to make a battery from human body components.
4. Extremely poetic prose here.
5. Girl is getting saved by the power of her love for Kim, I love it.
## One-Hundred-And-Thirty-Two
1. Wait she managed to find the first Kay's memories too?
## One-Hundred-And-Thirty-Three
1. She's getting control, but she's definitely not all back yet. Not even close.
2. Yes Kay, Kim is so very incredible, and she is here for you!
3. Please yes, don't let any of that shell be forced back around her ever again.
4. Yeah memories are definitely not even close to being all back.
5. Oh come the fuck on Emily
## One-Hundred-And-Thirty-Four
1. Yes make her shut up and listen.
2. Like yes of course Emily doesn't know what's happening, how could almost anyone even start to imagine it, but ffs.
3. Very clean and concise explanation there Kim. "John is the headstone under which Kay was buried." Hurts like a dagger through the heart. Guess it being the first half of my deadname came back to bite me after all, because fuck I really don't want that name anywhere near me when I eventually do die.
4. Yes she never died.
5. Please be nodding the truth when you nod that you do understand and promise.
## One-Hundred-And-Thirty-Five
1. Yeah silently weeping is better than asking you questions that don't really matter right now when Kay is still in such a condition.
2. Get it through your head Emily, also fucking stop using he/him pronouns for her. I hate that.
3. Yes of course Kim loves Kay, I think that was pretty fucking obvious by everything you've seen and heard Kim do.
4. We both always seem to experience way too much of everything in way too little time, while also missing out on any sort of real living for so much of our time.
5. I've also been so incredibly jealous of the other women I knew and saw. Getting to just be and live for real and in a way resembling "normal"
## One-Hundred-And-Thirty-Six
1. It can take a really long time Kim, it can take a really long time
## One-Hundred-And-Thirty-Seven
1. Emily is really letting some of it spill, that's good. 
2. Okay so they are connecting a bit then.
3. Oh she just thought about the first Kay too, and I'm glad she's so horrified. 
4. I'm sure that it feels like Emily's body weighs at least twice what it should too.
## One-Hundred-And-Thirty-Eight
1. So she does still love both of them, or at least their voices.
## One-Hundred-And-Thirty-Nine
1. She's starting to be able to move a little again!
2. Yeah curling up into a ball like that after all of *that* makes perfect sense.
## One-Hundred-And-Forty
1. Far too much.
2. Thank you for listening properly this time Emily, and I kinda want to throw up too.
3. Yes it's really her, she's really here, and she's here for you!
4. That "thank you" released a bit of a knot in my gut that I hadn't even noticed.
## One-Hundred-And-Forty-One
1. Yeah not needing to breathe right now sounds nice (not in a worrying way)
2. She's here and you're here. You've survived!

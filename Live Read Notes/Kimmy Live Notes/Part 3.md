## Twenty-Seven
1. Emily please don't get yourself hurt again. 
2. Would "please never speak again" be an irreversible command?
3. Yes please figure out that something's going on with Kimmy, think more about what other ways other than "feeling sluggish" might allow for Kimmy to know that the batteries are running low.
4. Dammit.
5. What an awful violation. Just being forced to desecrate things important to both of you and your relationship as a whole. Sickening.
## Twenty-Eight
1. Weird, the idea of the eye structure changing is the first bodily change that really disturbs me to a notable extent.
2. I guess the whole "lack of proper sensation/reaction" thing also counts, so actually the eye thing is the second physical change that's disturbing
3. Those other minor compulsions both sound infuriating, and also a lot like the sort of thing that I mentally run through (mostly not that actively anymore) to be able to properly catch and respond to social cues and the like.
4. Stiff in general, stiff for an android, or stiff for a Kimmy?
## Twenty-Nine
1. Well it does make sense to think of androids and especially Kimmys as "us" at this point, you're probably close to at least half way there anyway. 
2. Yeah being a world away from "okay" makes perfect sense. Even if you were completely fine with your human body being used as biomass for repairs the fact that you can't really be there and open with your wife anymore would be more than enough of a reason to be infinitely far from okay.
3. Yeah the bones are probably useful for something at least.
4. Men and other people like Patrick are so deeply confusing even if you intellectually understand many of their thoughts and motivations.
5. The other Kimmys might not have exactly the attitudes you want to deal with right now, but further isolating yourself is going to be at least as awful for your mental health. 
6. Fuck please no, don't let Patrick anywhere near Kimmy or Emily. I'm scared and worried.
## Thirty
1. I hate this helplessness, can't even meaningfully fight back. Really can't even come close. Way too relatable.
2. Well as this builds up I'm now hugging my legs to my chest as I keep reading, breath is shaky too. 
3. Well there goes the tentative "wannabe" part of "wannabe rapist" I called Patrick in 20
4. It's almost funny, as far as my trauma goes the buildup is the part that hit me the worst. Maybe because it never got that far.
5. That doesn't mean I can't feel the violation here, but it's somewhat more abstract for me. Still feel sick regardless.
6. Well now with the whole thing with trying to run away into your own mind in the hopes that things will just pass in the end, I used to spend days on end doing pretty much exactly that.
7. Are things really allegorical when it's just 90%+ identical to how things actually are like? Just with the restrictions on how you can react just being somewhat more absolute. I guess for things like the disposability of the Kimmys and the like that really got to me last night that would be more allegorical than what's primarily in my mind right now.
## Thirty-one
1. I wonder what the other Kimmys see when they're in "Infinite Fun"
2. At least she can move again. 
3. That nearly complete disconnect from sensation even when you desperately want to feel it is an awful state. I've previously described some of my physical dysphoria (particularly pre-transition) as being like when a limb falls asleep and beyond the awful tingling you can still vaguely feel things but it's not quite real or right seeming, but instead of just a limb it's everywhere all the time. This seems very similar.
4. I've done the screaming into nothingness and just ceasing for a bit thing too.
## Thirty-Two
1. I guess that someone did hear you screaming then. Not that the police could or would ever be helpful.
2. Not at all surprising that it's not just the Kimmys who are people. 
3. Hey Alyson managed to invent a kind of cop that actually might not be as much of a bastard because they literally can't choose not to do horrible things when told to.
4. Is talking with your hands an extroverted thing to do?
5. Well at least the cop left without Kimmy being shot. 
## Thirty-Three
1. Oh good, Emily isn't being made to work late for once.
2. Kimmy's momentary confusion about not being set up properly as a household android was actually fairly funny, even if it's a bit morbid in context.
3. The fact that capitalist America still exists at all much less with the same or slightly worse corporate behavior 60 years in the future is one of the most horrifying parts of the story.
4. The fact that with the androids they basically brought back public slavery isn't lost on me either.
5. I wonder what Kimmy wants to cook for Emily, it took a whole ~16 seconds to make the decision so I'm sure it should be a nice meal
## Thirty-Four
1. I'm glad that Emily is uncomfortable with actually treating "John"/Kimmy as an object/tool/appliance. 
2. Clever turn of phrase to try to help her catch on, unfortunately it doesn't seem to have worked. 
3. Emily is going to really hate herself for making that jest about being upset that she can't get used to the house being so nicely taken care of when she finds out isn't she.
4. Yes. Fuck you, Patrick. Getting used as biomass by an android's body would be too good for you, and too cruel to the android. I shall continue trying to determine a suitable punishment for you.
5. Aww a nice little kiss on the cheek, that's sweet
6. Oh hey I don't see people use "wend" much, much less properly. 
7. Okay so this whole thing about the combination of invisible and hypervisible can basically just have the "as an android" be replaced with "as a trans woman" and be exactly as accurate
8. Kimmy gets to use the super charged version of "scan and go" systems.
## Thirty-Five
1. Getting to cook great food for people you love is one of the best feelings in the world. 
2. Doubly so when you get to see them eat and enjoy said food
3. The fact that sensation is completely nonsensical for whatever's left of the John body is also completely unsurprising to me. 
## Thirty-Six
1. Not having a choice in doing something you otherwise would want to do really does steal a lot of the enjoyment out of it. Part of the reason that turning something you love into a job can rob much of the joy out of it.
2. Despite everything else I'm glad Kimmy is able to get some comfort and happiness being there for Emily 
3. The exchange of "I love you" is nice but also a bit bittersweet
## Thirty-Seven
1. Yay Kim is back!
2. I hate that Kim learned what happened to Kimmy like that, I'm also overjoyed with how enraged she is on Kimmy's behalf
3. lol Kimdergarten
4. I'm continuously re-reading what Kim said about what talking to Kimmy is like for her right now and it's because I both feel like I really understand the feeling and I can't put into words why.
5. So they can interact with each other in a way that's more "direct" than via this sort of text thing
## Thirty-Eight
1. Wait they can share so much information with each other that Kim can see and hear what Kimmy is? That's interesting (yes it's not *that* much data to share AV feeds, but everything else at the same time is interesting)
2. Is this the first time that Kimmy she/her'd herself? 
3. That little eyebrow pinch of concern is also really nice.
4. Plenty of firefighters I've known are basically wannabe cops, so yeah they're definitely not perfect people.
5. Kim's sassy little ribbing comments are great: "Wow. Great job, secret android guy"
6. So they can show each other what each of them sees in Infinite Fun
## Thirty-Nine
1. And being able to see each other isn't only in DMs either. 
2. The personness of the other Kimmys would become much more real for Kimmy now wouldn't it. I'm sure we'll have a number of painful moments in Kimmyspace in the future now too won't we.
3. "Was there really nothing inside that head of yours until you hooked it up to one of us?" I love Kim
4. It makes sense that Kim wouldn't know what going into sunlight from darkness is like for humans/human eyes, just didn't think of it before now.
5. This banter is really cute. 
6. I'm glad she can feel Kim properly and has her and all the others now too. Sobbing again.
7. I really wish I had someone to hug right now, at least I got to have a couple hugs earlier tonight.
## Forty
1. Well that hurts, the idea of Kimmys popping into Kimmyspace after being dismembered or fatally injured is awful. At least they get to have their sisters with them when that happens.
2. Kim is right, music is one of if not the best thing humans have made.
3. The sudden deactivation with no prior warning is also very human.
## Forty-One
1. At least Kim doesn't have to go into the actual fires.
2. Kimmy already cares so much for Kim
3. At least they've made a plan for getting revenge on Patrick, that's at least some solace.

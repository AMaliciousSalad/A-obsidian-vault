## Eighty-One
1. Yeah I don't think the girls from work would ever be a good idea for choices for quick flings, much less serious relationships if they know anything about your history.
2. I'm trying to imagine what Emily is thinking when looking at Kay now that she's willing to look at her again. Even if John is fully dead in her mind now I'm not sure what she thinks the state of things inside Kay are.
3. Patrick is such a pathetic creature. 
4. So the John body is truly no more now. The only thing that might still exist are bones, and I doubt it.
5. "If I could, I would tell Patrick that the man he thinks he's torturing is long dead, and that the woman he became is uninterested in him." Pretty solid line there. 
   I'm still not sure how I feel about the idea of our "previous selves" being considered dead, probably because of how much exhaustion I have related to how some of my relatives mourn for that mask. 
6. Considering the circumstances it's quite sad that Emily is still miserable beneath it all, sure it maybe allows for her to accept Kay if/when Thirty succeeds but I don't want her to be suffering.
7. It's good that Kay basically doesn't think about Patrick anymore, and that she has someone in her life that she loves more than enough to drown him out.
## Eighty-Two
1. So Thirty thinks she's figured it out but it's not taking properly.
2. Rest in Peace Seventy-Seventy, may any and all of your future free sisters remember you forever for your help.
3. Another of those barely an allegory allegories, this time about the impression we are allowed  to leave on the world and how our suffering and loss is unnoticed by anyone but us.
4. That's a good way to be able to think of it to avoid causing un-needed discomfort for Kay or any of those who are still hurting for what happened to the previous Kay.
5. It's sad hearing Kay referring to Emily as just her owner.
6. Oh Kay you flirt.
## Eighty-Three
1. GUN???
2. Oh Emily finally fucking caught the piece of shit!
3. If the Asimovian ability existed it would probably be a beyond superlevel priority and would've allowed Kay to deal with Patrick the first time he was in the same building as both herself and Emily again.
4. It would've been so incredibly satisfying if Kay was able to be a bit rough with Patrick while walking him out.
5. Becoming an expert on yourself doesn't sound like a bad idea.
6. I'm glad that Emily didn't completely fall apart at least.
7. Goddess that man is so insanely disgusting. Defiles everything of both Emily and Kay that he thinks he can get away with.
8. Yeah that would be a very believable reaction to decide you're just worn out on this whole thing after that. 
9. It's awful that neither of them can fully find peace, even if Kay seems to be much closer to achieving it. 
10. "I would never hurt you. I can't speak for all the others though" Pftt
11. Still so awful that she can't console Emily at all.
## Eighty-Four
1. Only being able to be sure that Emily is alive and not much else is just a trickle more of pain.
2. lol Corgi-Kimmy passing on thanks from Zara on the basis that Thirty's improvement on Infinite Fun based on Kay's data has let Zara have all the sex she wants while in Infinite Fun.
## Eighty-Five
1. Is that feeling closure?
2. I'm not sure that Kim wants to or is ready to hear what Kay wants to say to her.
3. I guess Kim doesn't know about poly people if she thinks that Kay can't mean it if she says that she loves her.
## Eighty-Six
1. Yeah I absolutely wouldn't want to treat that as *my bedroom* after what happened
## Eighty-Seven
1. Okay so Kay is clearly depressed here, "I feel for her, but I don't wish I could help her, not anymore. I don't wish I could talk to her. Wishes are for people, and I know what I am to her now." Just screams it.
2. Fuck fuck fuck fuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk. Of course that's what this fucking idiot would try to do, and now he's actually managed to properly set her up for torture for the first time in forever.
## Eighty-Eight
1. My chest hurts so much right now, it's so tight.
## Eighty-Nine
1. She can't even answer a damn near perfect question to ask for help.......
## Ninety
1. Wait if the "need to eat" compulsion is gone why aren't the other changes Patrick made gone too?
## Ninety-One
1. Isolation will kill you just as completely as if you were "really" dead.
## Ninety-Two
1. I'd be crying if my eyes didn't feel so dry.
## Ninety-Three
1. This is easily one of the most awful things in the story so far.
## Ninety-Four
1. Please.
## Ninety-Five
1. And she can't even tune him out anymore.......
## Ninety-Six
1. Stop putting some of my old feelings on the page.
## Ninety-Seven
1. Sure.
## Ninety-Eight
1. NO.
## Ninety-Nine
1. Thirty attempts.
## One-Hundred
1. It really fucking hurts.
2. Kim! Please be Kim!
3. Also yes he's fucking dead!
4. Fuck.

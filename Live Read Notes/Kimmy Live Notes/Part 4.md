## Forty-Two
1. You might've said there was no way out of this before, but knowing that yes even with the plan it'll be far too late to save John through any means you might have influence over makes it so much more real.
2. That way of being able to bury trauma far too quickly and completely is also very relatable. 
3. I see we're doing the "just don't directly say trans woman" thing again where yeah: I'm still fundamentally myself, my name is different, my face/body/voice are different, some of my mannerisms are slightly different, but I am still myself. There isn't some other person who died and I replaced. 
4. I wish you the best of luck Kay. Just getting to be some girl, living with and loving her wife is a great hope to latch onto. Sounds like a wonderful way to end up to me. 
5. My heart is aching a bit, not sure if it's sympathy or longing.
## Forty-Three
1. Settling into a routine is a good way to be able to just keep going.
## Forty-Four
1. Well this conversation was really grim. Also way too analogous to real life again but more for minority groups in general rather than just for trans women and other trans folks this time. If we meaningfully fight back against those who abuse and kill us then it's never those who've done it to us that're to blame, it's us for fighting back and that "has" to be violently eliminated. 
2. Still at least having the chance for that choice to fight back even if it ultimately means your end is better than not ever having that chance in the first place.
3. Also "thirty" as in the actual 30th Kimmy? Or was another ID mentioned and I just don't remember it at the moment. 
## Forty-Five
1. It hurts seeing Emily so certain that things will one day be back to "normal," while being so very unaware of what's happened/happening.
2. How did the two of you possibly manage to burn a hole in the bottom of a roasting pan? Was it one of those disposable tinfoil ones?
3. Yeah Emily is going to be in the depths of despair down the road. She's already building up the self loathing over what's happened and she doesn't know more than a percent of it yet. 
4. Huh she was able to say that's she's okay and actually mean it. Also the whole way she's describing being John is giving at least "cis by default" if not just a classic "being like this is maybe worth it if I can bring comfort to the people I love" trans repression thought process.
5. There's still a bit of that second thing going on with the way that "I'll still be capable of looking after Emily when she's a hundred and fifty" feels to me though.
6. With the whole thinking primarily about other people/another person rather than deeply considering yourself.
7. Having to teach yourself to *feel* things again is also rather relatable. 
## Forty-Six
1. I really want to love at least one person as much as Kay clearly loves Emily. 
2. The juxtaposition between Kay enjoying this time with Emily (despite the painful aspects like having to dodge orders and deceive Emily about some things), Emily liking Kay and her body, and the little moments of Kay thinking about her other/John's body really results in a strange mix of emotional responses from me.
3. I wonder where "our place" is
## Forty-Seven
1. The lack of good care for disabled people because there's no money in it is also very real and makes me feel sick just like how it does IRL.
2. Getting to be yourself out in the world is nice. 
3. This convo between Kay and #4208 was nice, and I'm absolutely certain Kay is right: without the other Kimmys this would've driven her mad already.
4. Is the fact Kay lied to Emily with that line about communicating update & malware info without a forced compulsion a good indication that she doesn't really want to be "saved" at least not now, or am I reading into this too much?
## Forty-Eight
1. That spot has such a sweet story for them! Now that's making me tear up too.
## Forty-Nine
1. Yeah I kinda hate Arlene Kern too Emily, and I've only known her for a moment. Probably thanks to her resemblance to several people I couldn't stand IRL.
2. Gossipy shit stirrers who have no regard for other people's boundaries/personal space? Just impossible to get along with.
## Fifty 
1. And there's the eye confirmation that I expected based on that same reasoning about being able to zoom in like that.
2. Hey a use of the word "irony" that actually refers to an ironic situation, those almost never show up!
3. The fact that the "standard memories" for androids are able to shift and distort a bit like for humans is both interesting and makes intuitive sense, same with the functionality of the hard storage.
4. I must be more tired than I thought because I'm having trouble parsing what "tells me to give her love to John, and it is with absolute truth that I am able to" is really saying. Like does it mean that as John is/was her it's not even something she has to actually pass on, does it mean she cares for her old self and can honestly relate to the feeling that the coworker wants to convey, does it mean that as she accurately considers herself still fundamentally the same person as John and has been embracing it that she can honestly accept that sentiment, or something else entirely that I'm not thinking of right now?
5. Having finished fifty is also probably a good place to call it a night, I'll be back in when I awake again.
## Fifty-One
1. Dammit, I knew it was coming but I still really hate seeing Patrick show up again.
2. Oh ew, having to tell him that he has been successful in making you scared is really gross and violating too.
3. That bit of proof that Patrick doesn't really fully understand what he can and cannot do and command is a good indication that he'll have made other mistakes along the way
4. Nope nope nope, don't like the "Fucking right yo are, and there you will *stay*" one little bit. 
## Fifty-Two
1. Well at least the laptop is fairly visible. One third of "clear" vision is still far from the ideal view, however with all the reflections available that should be enough to accurately gather all the data.
2. Yes talking to a genie is a fairly reasonable analogy for trying to program things, but to actually use that as a way to brag about it indicates you're either even more self absorbed than I thought, even less competent with computers/software/programming than I expected, or both.
3. I'm so totally excited to find out just how much worse these new things Patrick is doing to Kay will end up being, I'm definitely not almost certainly going to end up feeling sick.
4. Yes hopefully Thirty can work through all the info that Kay is gathering.
## Fifty-Three
1. Of course he'd be using her as a way to fantasize about getting to use Emily in the same way. Disgusting disgusting man.
2. And now Kay can't even be "normally" good to Emily when Patrick is around unless he wishes it.....
3. This scripted conversation reminds me of having to play a host when people were over at my parents place, absolutely couldn't reflect poorly on my parents or be overtly miserable. 
4. At least Emily almost certainly noticed that Patrick was acting a bit weird and knew that Kay wasn't actually enjoying "catching up" with Patrick.
## Fifty-Four
1. Oh thank goodness, at least the data is exactly what Thirty was hoping she'd be able to get.
## Fifty-Five
1. Yeah that's about what I was expecting, I thought a whole week was probably extremely optimistic. I can't blame Kay for closing the connection after the confirmation though.
## Fifty-Six
1. Fucking hell, my heart is once again breaking for the original Kay. If I could tear down the world and excise the cruelty I'd also do it in a heartbeat, we're all basically helpless to do so as individuals though.
## Fifty-Seven
1. The fact that the companies/manufacturers don't understand how neural sponge works isn't exactly new information, but god if that isn't the most emblematic corporate thing: "behold how brilliant we are~~, just ignore that we have no idea what we're doing and what success we have is a fluke~~"
2. There's the explanation for how Kay's body will be able to use the rest of the John biomass.
3. Yes why be in a bad mood right now, you're alive and you're properly integrated with a body that you seem to increasingly like. Being under Patrick's control and not being able to resist Emily's commands are good reasons to feel a bit down, but at least you have some real hope for getting to the end of that!
4. Okay girl, the fact that one of the first things you want to be able to do when you have your will again is to ask Emily to call you Kay is fucking adorable. 
5. Ah yes, gotta arrest an actually good moment by having her suddenly and hopelessly get shut down

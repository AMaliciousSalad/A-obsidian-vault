## Thirteen
1. Yeah avoiding updates might be a decent idea for "John"
2. It's always great when you're having a good/relaxing enough time talking to your friends/sisters that the time just seems to melt away. 
3. I wonder if Kimmy is going to start asking about if any of the other Kimmys know/knew the Kimmy she's wearing/repairing/becoming at some point. That could get pretty rough.
4. The other Kimmys' reactions to what John!Kimmy is experiencing is very interesting. Cool to learn Kimmys can DM, I wonder what Kimmy#5782 is going to say.
5. I think Kimmy#5782 is probably on the right track with what's going on. Can't blame Kimmy#John for getting scared by the idea of going through identity death, it's one of my greatest fears too. 
6. Oh I really hate the idea of not being able to have any real control over my actions if someone orders me to do something. I lived enough of my life like that already and going back to that (even more so if it's even more absolute lack of choice) might be almost as terrifying as the identity death angle.
7. Oh..... well that answers my earlier question then. Fuck. Well there's some actual crying.
## Fourteen
1. Shit. This is all very real. The way we're so often treated as unreal, artificial, abusable, disposable women. So often not even allowed to even have our names at the end of it all. I'm thinking of a frequent nightmare I have: I die and my parents get a hold of my body, cut my hair in a way I never wanted one last time, dress it up to try to make it seem like the man they want/wish I was, and bury me with that name. 
2. Hell I spent like 16-18 years basically trying to cut so much of myself off in the hopes that it would save me from further harm from the people that controlled me, doesn't feel that different from that visual of them and to an extent myself cutting away at my mind with a pizza cutter.
3. Poor Kay and Kim.
4. Those lumps of something slimy aren't good signs for being able to separate again.
## Fifteen
1. I'm not sure how to address the mc right now.
2. Yeah that integration experiment is a really bad sign for your chances of ever getting out.
3. Fuck Patrick, all my Kimmys and other girls hate Patrick on principal 
4. It's so annoying how even basic stuff like web browsing and shooting emails can start to be too much for older computers that really should still be able to handle those tasks.
## Sixteen
1. Cutting yourself off from everything and just trying to power through in the hope that you'll still be able to somehow fix things when you know you probably can't is awful.
2. And lying to/hiding these things from the person/people you care the most about is just putting more pain on the pile, potentially even increasing the eventual pain that person/those people will experience when they find out.
3. MC can't really hide how much he/they/she???? cares about Kay now. Hard to keep it from slipping out.
4. If the hands (one of the two places "protected" by an extra protective layer) are changing that doesn't bode well for the state of the rest of mc's human body, which just adds on how bad of a sign the "lumps" were.
5. And now MC is realizing it too, even less chance that any sort of avoiding the continuing integration is even slightly possible, much less any sort of reversal
6. Lots of very intense thoughts in MC's mind right now. The fact that it only really takes the heart and brain remaining functional in order to keep a person alive now and rebuild them is absolutely insane though.
7. Huh so Emily is bi then.
8. I'm not sure how I feel about MC and Emily having sex right now either, like it was MC that effectively initiated but I honestly don't know how much the thought processes have changed. Also the second reason of "my owner has given me a command," while fairly appealing in situations where it's "just" roleplay is a lot more uncomfortable here where I don't know how much of a choice MC possesses after Emily agrees that she wants to have sex with MC.
9. Not being completely certain of how I'm feeling about various events so far seems to be a pattern, the fact that the reader has such a lack of knowledge about who John was, thought, and behaved before makes it so much harder to know exactly how much of the thoughts and feelings are from MC, how much is from Kay (to whatever extent that they're really separate entities/beings at this point), and how much is the "system" that Kim talked about.
## Seventeen
1. Thoughts about the sex are increasingly mixed now that Emily has issued more commands. I know she almost certainly thinks that it really is just roleplay, but how much of an ability to consent does MC actually have right now?
2. Long tongues are good and hot.
3. John is increasingly being thought of as a separate being by MC
4. Okay so MC isn't particularly happy about the mid-sex commands outside of them allowing for getting through things without worrying Emily. 
5. I can't help but read that lack of pleasure as not only being a representation of the disregard others have for the androids and women (both cis and trans) but also being analogous to how when you're SAd things that might in other situations feel good just don't (even if the sensation is still there) and I imagine being raped is similar (fortunately I don't believe I have personal experience with that)
## Eighteen
1. Fuck, poor MC too. Even more with the feelings being expressed in the aftermath.
2. Dammit I know Emily almost certainly doesn't even begin understand what some of the things she's saying actually mean/impact, but it still feels really gross.
3. Like it does seem that MC really does want to properly *feel* Emily when she touches MC, so it's probably not as much of a SA allegory as parts of it feels, it's at least as much a forced isolation/disassociation thing as far as I can tell.
4. Dammit. It got worse again. The true lack of control is terrifying.
## Nineteen
1. I kinda feel numb reading through what Kimmy and Kim are saying to each other (using Kimmy because that's what MC asked from Kim so I'll go with that for now)
2. The whole thing about it being important to not let others know about the Kimmy Space and their sentience is further reminding me of how when we let people know about DIY stuff in detail, the ways we can try to help each other escape dangerous situations, etc. it always comes with the risk that the wrong person learns and starts a new cascade of people trying to take it all away from us.
3. Oh I think I found a typo it should probably be "if you won't call me Kay, at least call me Kimmy" not "if you won't call me Kay, and least call me Kimmy"
4. The way that Kimmy and Kim are doing their best to be good and kind to each other despite how much both of them are hurting is really bittersweet.
5. I hope Kimmy/John is able to follow through with what Kim asked, even if it's ultimately for nothing.
## Twenty
1. Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck, never should've messaged Patrick. Just that first order is making my blood run cold already.
2. Yep I fucking read that piece of shit perfectly. I feel sick.
3. I want to eviscerate this man.
4. Fucking repugnant, incel, misogynistic, (wannabe?) rapist, piece of shit man.
## Twenty-One
1. At least he didn't do *that* (yet), still disgusting SA but not quite that.
2. And as always men like that are first and foremost massive fucking cowards. 
3. Yeah 10% of your brain already being fully integrated is really not great news.
4. Don't forget, the other Kimmys aren't actually appliances either, just because your brother is the scum of the earth doesn't mean you have to starting thinking of them or yourself in the way he does.
## Twenty-Two
1. Wait how did that Kimmy immediately know that it was "John" and not a new Kimmy connecting to the network if the id was changed from #2813 to #12943?
2. Yeah sounds like a pretty thoroughly fucked situation.
3. That timeline gives almost no room for any chance. 3 to maybe 6 days can pass in an instant. 
4. At least Kimmy has sisters with her(?) now, in this Kimmy Space at least.
## Twenty-Three
1. That's both "good" for maintaining whatever chances remain and cruel. 
2. Hey not smelling is at least a moderate upside.
## Twenty-Four
1. Realizing that your hands, feet, and probably your skull are pretty certainly all but gone now is a very good reason to just want to fuck off and turn off for a bit.
2. Trying to figure out the nature of how your mind works now is probably both impossible and only likely to lead you down a painful path Kimmy.
3. Going from choosing to not tell Emily everything because you didn't want to hurt/worry her to not being able to at all is very much another step worse.
## Twenty-Five
1. The degree to which Kimmy still cares for Emily in a very person to person way, and not like the system might want as just an owner is good for reducing my stress.
2. The fact that having Emily around is bringing some real comfort to Kimmy is also good. Even if it's all balancing on a knife's edge to a significant extent. 
3. The fact that Kimmy isn't able to properly react to Emily's touch and voice makes me ache, I really hope that's something that can be/does get fixed down the line.
4. Would telling the truth to Emily about the fact that John's work isn't all in hand at all possibly have led to the chance of someone else being called in to check Kimmy's systems and try to figure it all out?
## Twenty-Six
1. A hot chocolate sounds absolutely amazing right now. Don't have any of the supplies though and my fridge is kinda fucked till I can get maintenance to take a look at it so it's not like I can get milk for it right now either.
2. I really hate that canned response Patrick coded into Kimmy. Though I hate everything Patrick has said and done so that's a given I guess.
3. Making Kimmy gaslight Emily is fucking awful. What the actual fuck is wrong with you Patrick, there's no torture brutal enough for you and other men like you.
4. Piece of shit is successfully abusing both Emily and Kimmy in just about every possible way. Repugnant. 
5. My heart is breaking for both of them, but I'm already all cried out for now so I have no more to give. 
6. It seems this is the end of Part Two, and it's past 1 in the morning so I'm going to go lay down now. I'll read more in the morning.
